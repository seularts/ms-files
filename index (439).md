## OWASP-Cotonou Chapter aims

Benin is located in West Africa between Nigeria and Togo. At one time,
in Benin, computer security was just a matter of science fiction, but in
recent years there has been a craze for information system security
issues through the creation of government agencies whose objective is to
address security issues. In addition, universities that previously did
not train security experts have begun to do so. E-services are deployed
in publics and private administrations in all around the country. The
OWASP-Cotonou chapter aims to contribute to the awareness of software
security issues in Benin through activities offered by the OWASP
foundation.

Specifically, the enormous resources made available by the OWASP
community around the world constitute an opportunity for public
authorities, decision-makers, new graduates in terms of training, good
practices and networking. Our mission and main priority is to use these
resources to create cybersecurity awareness in Cotonou and Benin in
general.
