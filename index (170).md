## About Code Pulse

The OWASP Code Pulse Project is a tool that provides insight into the
real-time code coverage of black box testing activities. It is a
cross-platform desktop application that runs on most major platforms.

![Codepulse Screenshot](assets/images/Codepulse-screenshot.png)

## How it works

Code Pulse does its magic by monitoring the runtime of the target
application using an agent-based approach. Code Pulse currently supports
Java programs, up to Java 11, and .NET Framework programs for CLR
versions 2 and 4. It can track code coverage details at the method or
source code level to show what's being called and when. Although Code
Pulse works for desktop applications, our current focus is on providing
the best experience for web application testing. Code Pulse 2.6
incorporates the OWASP Attack Surface Detector and helps you see code
coverage details for the endpoints of a web application.

## Why Code Pulse?

Whereas in the past it's been very difficult to understand which parts
of an application a DAST or manual penetration test covered, Code Pulse
automatically detects the coverage information while the tests are being
conducted and will even make it possible to understand the overlaps and
boundaries of the different tools' coverage.

Code Pulse presents the coverage information in a visual form to make it
easy to understand at-a-glance which parts of an application have been
covered, and how much. The real-time coverage feedback makes it easy to
adjust testing activity based on the observed coverage. In addition for
testing activities relying on multiple techniques (a variety of dynamic
analysis tools for instance), it's fairly easy to split up the recorded
activity to understand which code was covered by each tool independently
or to view where the coverage overlaps between multiple tools.

## Road Map and Getting Involved

The initial version of Code Pulse, version 1.0, was released in early
May 2014. Since then, we've pushed out multiple versions to address some
usability issues and to include support for Java 11, .NET Framework
applications, an OWASP Dependency Check integration, and code coverage
details at the source code level.

Long-term there are a number of things on our roadmap that we'd like to
add to Code Pulse. The following is a partial list of features we'd like
to add to Code Pulse as we continue development on it:

- Web request filter

- Performance improvements

Involvement in the development and promotion of Code Pulse is actively
encouraged!

You do not have to be a security expert in order to contribute.

Some of the ways you can help:

- Code contributions
- Testing
- Wiki documentation
- Spreading the word about the project!
