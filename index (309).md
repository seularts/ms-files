- Introduction to OWASP Ottawa, Public Announcements.
- Hacking the Human Firewall, Insights from Social Engineering
  Corporations.

### Abstract:

Despite significant investments in cutting-edge security technologies,
the human element remains the weakest link in cybersecurity. Attackers
continuously exploit human behavior to bypass even the most advanced
technology defences. This presentation will provide experiences of
hands-on real-world social engineering campaigns, mirroring the tactics
used by sophisticated threat actors. We will explore: â€¢ OSINT -
Determining Targets and Entry Points â€¢ NIST Phish Scale - Evaluating the
Content of a Phishing Email â€¢ Email Phishing - How Attackers Get SPAM
Into the Corporate Inbox â€¢ Phone Social Engineering - Experiences in
Impersonation and Taking Over Accounts â€¢ Physical Security - Outcomes
from Just Hanging Around the Office Attendees will gain valuable
insights into the psychology and strategies behind social engineering
attacks, along with practical safeguards to strengthen their
organization's security posture against these evolving threats.

If you are coming into town by car to attend a meetup then you may have
questions about parking. Below is a Ottawa University Campus parking
map:

[Parking
Map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1J8fmNjkJf_FnA0MECBCQUaNSZIg&ll=45.42237504524721%2C-75.68136513233185&z=16)

Alternatively, you can try your luck on street parking in Sandy Hill or
in the Triangle on the other side of the canal (you can cross over using
the Corkstown pedestrian bridge).

Even better, use the train as there is a station on campus.
