## Description

### Problem

In today\'s world, Network and System Security are of paramount
importance in the digital communication environment. On par with the
developments in technology, many threats have emerged for information
security which has worse effects when it comes to sensitive
transactions. Nowadays, intruders can easily break the walls of the
network and can cause many kinds of breaches such as the crash of the
networks, Denial Of Service, injecting Malware and so on. In order to
avoid those breaches, it is badly needed for a security administrator to
detect the intruder and prevent him from entering into the network. In
daily life, new threats and associated solutions are emerging together.

### Proposed Solution {#proposed_solution}

A Hybrid Intrusion Detection System by leveraging the benefits of
Machine Learning techniques to build a system which detects the
intrusion and alerts the respective network administrator. This can be
extended from Intrusion to breach detection as well. The developed
system analyses and predicts the behavior of users which in turn
classifies as an anomaly or a normal behavior.

### Use Case Scenarios {#use_case_scenarios}

- Denial of Service (DoS): Attacker tries to prevent legitimate users
  from using a service.
- Probe: Attacker tries to gain information about the target host.
- U2R: Attacker has local access to the victim machine and tries to gain
  super user privileges.
- R2L: Attacker does not have an account on the victim machine, hence
  tries to gain access.

## Licensing

OWASP Intelligent Intrusion Detection System is free to use. It is
licensed under GNU GPL v3 License (allows commercial use, but requires
that modifications to your code stay open source, thus prohibiting
proprietary forks of your project)

## Roadmap

**\</p\>**

- Setup project architecture

- List down V1.0 features

- Push the project base to github repository

- Implement POSEIDON on DARPA Dataset

- Get more contributors to the project

  \</ul\>
