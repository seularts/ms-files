Traditionally OWASP offered in-person instructor led trainings as a part
of Global AppSec Conferences which take place two or three times a year.
However the OWASP Foundation gets requests for more frequent in-person
trainings.

OWASP Education and Training Committee has been working on a set of new
initiatives and one of them is collaborating with Events Committee to
schedule trainings over and above the currently offered trainings in
OWASP Global AppSec.

These trainings are aimed at bringing together trainers and students
more frequently.

The themes would be builder, breaker, defender and manager, the same as
what we currently have for Global AppSecs Conferences.

The process for registering for the trainings is the same as AppSec.
Watch out for the upcoming announcements on OWASP website.

The process for making submissions for training is the same as call for
trainers (CFT).

Students and organisations: Register and get trained with us to

- Enhance your knowledge on application security topics
- Meet any compliance requirements that need your developers to be
  trained on application security
- Know more about the latest trends in application security
- and many more

The training events will be announced soon. Please visit OWASP website
for more information and follow OWASP Foundation on social media.
