## Our Goal

In-depth attack surface management for everyone!

The OWASP Amass Project has developed a framework to help information
security professionals perform network mapping of attack surfaces and
external asset discovery using open source intelligence gathering and
reconnaissance techniques.

The framework includes a collection engine for asset discovery, an asset
database for storage of findings, and the Open Asset Model, used by
various tooling to help understand attack surfaces.

If you have any questions about the OWASP Amass Project, please email

## Participation

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit
foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our
projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to
anyone interested in improving application security.

### How can I participate in the project?

All you have to do is make the Project Leader aware of your available
time to [contribute to the
project](https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
It is also important to let the leader know how you would like to
contribute and pitch in to help the project meet its goals and
milestones. There are many different ways you can contribute to an OWASP
Project, but communication with the leader is key.

### If I am not a programmer can I participate in the project?

Yes, you can certainly participate in the project if you are not a
programmer. The project needs different skills and expertise at
different times during its development. Currently, we are looking for
researchers, programmers, testers, writers, and graphic designers.
