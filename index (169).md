OWASP Code Review Guide is a technical book written for those
responsible for code reviews (management, developers, security
professionals). The primary focus of this book has been divided into two
main sections. Section one is the "why and how of code reviews" and
section two focuses on the "types of vulnerabilities and how to identify
throughout the review". While security scanners are improving every day
the need for manual security code reviews still needs to have a
prominent place in organizations' SDLC (Secure Development Life Cycle)
that desires good secure code in production.

Chapters in the second section are mostly based on the popular OWASP
2013 top 10. Here you will find most of the code examples for both on
"what not to do" and on "what to do". A word of caution on code
examples; Perl is famous for its saying that there are 10,000 ways to do
one thing. The same is true for C#, PHP, and Java or any other computer
language. Now add in "Object-Oriented Programming" and if we are using
design patterns or even what designs patterns are being used and sample
code becomes very "iffy" in what to write. We tried to keep the sample
code so code reviewers can see red flags and not "do it my way or else".

The last section is the appendix. Here we have content like code
reviewer check list, etc. of items that really don't flow in book form
but needed to be included to make the code review guide complete.
