## Welcome

![](assets/images/Frame%201.png)

The OWASP IIITD Student Chapter was formed in 2022 with the aim of
spreading awareness about cybersecurity and malware. We share the same
goal as well as the motivation that OWASP shares. We welcome you all to
OWASP IIITD Chapter.

## About OWASP IIITD

Our aim and plan is to indulge in sharing our knowledge through CTFs,
spreading cybersecurity awareness through our posts on social media, and
conducting meetups and events. We try to bring reputed speakers in the
field of cybersecurity to share their insights and to keep the community
updated.

With a strength of more than 30 students, our organisational team is
broadly divided into the Technical Team and the Non Technical Team. The
Non Technical Team has various departments (Design, Operations, Content,
Web Development, Video Editing, Outreach, Finance) that work together to
make the chapter function. The Technical Team consists of students who
are experienced in the field of cybersecurity and have won numerous
awards at CTFs and competitions.
