## Welcome

Welcome to the home page of the OWASP PSNA College of Engineering and
Technology chapter.

Established in January 2023, the OWASP PSNA College of Engineering and
Technology Chapter is for students who are passionate about learning and
imparting knowledge about cyber security. This chapter emphasized
acquiring access to security training programs and networking with
numerous wonderful people through project volunteer work. Web
application security is becoming increasingly vital as the number of
threats to internet users rises. The main objective of this chapter is
to put together an array of tools,applications, learning guides, and
standards that enhance the overall well-being of the internet and assist
students increating, developing, steering, and utilizing web apps that
can be trusted
