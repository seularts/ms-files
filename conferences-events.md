Adopted by the Board on 22-Sept-2020

## Conference & Event Attendees {#conference--event-attendees}

The OWASP Foundation and its supporters host events around the world in
a variety of formats. The following policy applies to all OWASP branded
and "supported by OWASP" events. Other policies may apply and can be
found on the event's website.

### Registration and Badges

At events where a badge is provided, your badge must be always visible.
Spouses, friends, peers, etc. are not granted access to any conference
areas or events without a badge. If you wish for anyone to accompany you
to any of the conference events including meals, receptions, breaks or
sessions, you must register them and pay the appropriate fees. Lost,
misplaced, stolen, or forgotten badges will incur a replacement fee
equal to the current, on-site rate of your pass type. If your badge was
complimentary, the fee will be the current, on-site rate.

### Discount Codes

Some OWASP Events have attendee and participant fees. From time-to-time,
the Foundation may elect, at its sole discretion, to offer discounts for
certain attendees. Discount Codes are not transferable and using one
indicates that you qualify for the offer and its restrictions. Any
attempt to defraud the Foundation and its partners could result in the
cancellation of your registration with no refund.

### Cancellation Policy

Since ticket sales are final, the Foundation does not offer refunds. The
sole exception to this policy is when an event or session is cancelled
at the Foundation's convenience. Regional events can use their
discretion to make exceptions to this policy provided a sufficient
budget. We strongly suggest training registrants purchase travel
insurance in the event their session is cancelled.

### Privacy Policy Statement

Your attendance at OWASP Foundation Events and the information you
provide to participate in such are governed by the [OWASP Privacy
Policy](privacy.html). Additionally, please note in most cases, your
event registration information is also provided to sponsors to whom you
allow your badge to be scanned or business card collected. Attendees are
under no obligation to have their credentials scanned or collected, but
certain event sponsors may limit your eligibility for special event
giveaways or offers. If you do not wish to share your registration
information with event sponsors, please do not allow your credentials to
be scanned or collected.

During event registration and related communications, OWASP may collect
the following information:

- name and job title
- contact information including email address and phone number
- demographic information such as postcode, preferences and interests

### Photography

OWASP events are open to the public, and OWASP does not restrict
attendees (including OWASP staff, volunteers, sponsors, and media) from
taking photos or videos at our events. By attending our events, you
acknowledge that you are in a public space and that attendees (including
OWASP staff, volunteers, sponsors, and media) may capture your image in
photos and videos. Nevertheless, OWASP encourages event attendees to
exercise common sense and good judgment and respect the wishes of other
attendees who do not wish to be photographed at the Events.

OWASP reserves the right to use images taken at conference and events
with your photograph or likeness in future marketing materials.

### Conference and Event Anti-Harassment Policy

Attendees, staff, sponsors, and exhibitors at Foundation Conferences and
Events shall together provide a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate
harassment of conference participants in any form. Additionally,
participating in our events means you shall also adhere to the [Code of
Conduct](code-of-conduct.html).

Conference participants who violate these rules may be sanctioned or
expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the
conference organizers. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments
related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
body size, race, or religion, and actions such as deliberate
intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical
contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

- Participants who are asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected
  to comply immediately.
- Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar
  activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
  particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities,
  or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use
  sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a
  sexualized environment.
- If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference
  organizers may take appropriate action, including warning the offender
  or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
- If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
  or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference
  staff immediately.
- Conference staff will be available to help participants contact
  hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or
  otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the
  duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
