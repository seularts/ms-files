### OWASP Meeting Presenter Sponsorship

Although the OWASP Foundation is a non-profit organization and our
Algiers Chapter is a non-profit organization, we strive to provide our
members with the best presenters we possibly can. While the Algeria area
has tons of security talent, sometimes it's worthwhile to reach beyond
our borders to pull in more awesome presenters. In exchange for covering
travel expenses for these presenters, our chapter will provide you with
5 minutes talk at the start of the meeting to introduce yourself and
company to tell us about the products or services that your company
offers. You'll also receive mention of being the presenter sponsor in
all e-mail communications about the meeting and the company will be
included as a sponsor in all official communications of the chapter.
