## Welcome

The OWASP Student Chapter at Bharati Vidyapeeth (Deemed to be
University) College of Engineering,Pune (BVDUCOE) is a student-driven
initiative dedicated to fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness,
research, and innovation.

Established and led by **1. Prof. Gajanan Bhole(Faculty Advisor) , 2.
Ankit(Student Leader) and 3. Aaditya Gautam(Student Leader)**, the
chapter aims to create a dynamic learning environment where students can
explore the fundamentals and advanced concepts of web application
security, ethical hacking, and secure coding practices.

As an official affiliate of the Open Web Application Security Project
(OWASP), our chapter provides a platform for hands-on learning through
workshops, technical talks, hackathons, Capture The Flag (CTF)
competitions, and industry collaborations. We strive to bridge the gap
between academia and industry by engaging students with real-world
security challenges.

By bringing together a diverse group of enthusiastic learners, security
professionals, and researchers, we aim to cultivate a strong
cybersecurity community within our institution. Our vision is to equip
students with the knowledge, skills, and ethical mindset required to
combat modern cybersecurity threats and contribute meaningfully to the
field.

Join us as we build a more secure digital future, one step at a time.
