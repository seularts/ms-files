OWASP Cornucopia is a mechanism in the form of a card game to assist
software development teams identify security requirements in Agile,
conventional and formal development processes. It is language, platform
and technology-agnostic.

## Introduction

The idea behind Cornucopia is to help development teams, especially
those using Agile methodologies, to identify application security
requirements and develop security-based user stories. Although the idea
had been waiting for enough time to progress it, the final motivation
came when [SAFECode](http://www.safecode.org/) published its [Practical
Security Stories and Security Tasks for Agile Development
Environments](https://safecode.org/publication/SAFECode_Agile_Dev_Security0712.pdf)
in July 2012. Cornucopia was created and first used for developer
training in August 2012.

## Get the Cards

![OWASP Cornucopia deck and
cards](assets/images/Cornucopia-square-logo-350.jpg){.fa-pull-right
style="margin:0 0 1em 2em;"}

The primary source document is a [Word
document](https://github.com/OWASP/cornucopia/releases/tag/v2.0.0).

However, pre-printed card decks may be more useful, or there are links
to the source design files for the cards themselves (see links
underneath). You can also choose to play the OWASP Cornucopia Website
App Edition and Mobile App Edition online at
[copi.owasp.org](https://copi.owasp.org/)

### Printed

OWASP no longer has a stock of printed decks.

OWASP does not endorse or recommend commercial products or services.
However, [Agile Stationary](https://agilestationery.co.uk/) offer [large
print (v2.0) web app
decks](https://agilestationery.com/products/owasp-cornucopia-2-0-website-app-edition-threat-modeling-cards?_pos=2&_psq=cornucipia&_ss=e&_v=1.0)
and [large print (v1.0) mobile app
decks](https://agilestationery.com/products/owasp-cornucopia-mobile-app-edition-threat-modeling-cards?_pos=3&_psq=cornucip&_ss=e&_v=1.0).
They also offer a [croupier](https://croupier.agilestationery.co.uk/) to
help you distribute cards to team members. Also, [dotNET
lab](https://www.dotnetlab.eu/) sell a [printed
deck](https://webshop.dotnetlab.eu/product/cornucopia-card-deck/) which
complements their [online
reference](https://cornucopia.dotnetlab.eu/cards).

### Print your own

There are many ways to print copies of the card decks yourself:

1.  Download the free Adobe Illustrator files and get them
    professionally printed;
2.  Print the Word document onto business card blanks;
3.  Print the Word document onto normal card and cut the cards out
    individually using the guide; or
4.  Generate your own cards from the free source XML data file in the
    repository.

For instructions on printing your own decks, please go to
[cornucopia.owasp.org](https://cornucopia.owasp.org/printing)

### Source files

Source code to generate the Word document, PDFs and InDesign files for
printing are maintained in our [Github
repository](https://github.com/OWASP/cornucopia/releases)

## Frequently Asked Questions

![Cornucopia card Authorization -
8](assets/images/Cornucopia-card-authorization-8.png){.fa-pull-right
style="padding:1em;background-color:#dddddd;margin:0 0 1em 2em;"}

### Can I copy or edit the game?

Yes of course. All OWASP materials are free to do with as you like
provided you comply with the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0
license. Perhaps if you create a new version, you might donate it to the
OWASP Cornucopia Project?

### How can I get involved?

Please send ideas or offers of help to the project's List/Group.

### How were the attackers' names chosen?

EoP begins every description with words like "An attacker can...". These
have to be phrased as an attack but I was not keen on the anonymous
terminology, wanting something more engaging, and therefore used
personal names. These can be thought of as external or internal people
or aliases for computer systems. But instead of just random names, I
thought how they might reflect the OWASP community aspect. Therefore,
apart from "Alice and Bob", the original Ecommerce Website Edition used
the given (first) names of current and recent OWASP employees and Board
members (assigned in no order), and then randomly selected the remaining
50 or so names from the current list of paying individual OWASP members.
No name was used more than once, and where people had provided two
personal names, we dropped one part to try to ensure no-one can be
easily identified. Names were not deliberately allocated to any
particular attack, defence or requirement. The cultural and gender mix
simply reflects theses sources of names, and is not meant to be
world-representative. Some names have been changed over the years to
include some more recent project volunteers.

### Why aren't there any images on the card faces?

There is quite a lot of text on the cards, and the cross-referencing
takes up space too. But it would be great to have additional design
elements included.

### Are the attacks ranked by the number on the card?

Only approximately. The risk will be application and organisation
dependent, due to varying security and compliance requirements, so your
own severity rating may place the cards in some other order than the
numbers on the cards.

![Cornucopia card Cryptography -
Jack](assets/images/Cornucopia-card-cryptography-j.png){.fa-pull-right
style="padding:1em;background-color:#dddddd;margin:0 0 1em 2em;"}

### How long does it take to play a round of cards using the full deck?

This depends upon the amount of discussion and how familiar the players
are with application security concepts. But perhaps allow 1.5 to 2.0
hours for 4-6 people.

### What sort of people should play the game?

Always try to have a mix of roles who can contribute alternative
perspectives. But include someone who has a reasonable knowledge of
application vulnerability terminology. Otherwise try to include a mix of
architects, developers, testers and a relevant project manager or
business owner.

### Who should take notes and record scores?

It is better if that someone else, not playing the game, takes notes
about the requirements identified and issues discussed. This could be
used as training for a more junior developer, or performed by the
project manager. Some organisations have made a recording to review
afterwards when the requirements are written up more formally.

### Should we always use the full deck of cards?

No. A smaller deck is quicker to play. Start your first game with only
enough cards for two or three rounds. Always consider removing cards
that are not appropriate at all of the target application or function
being reviewed. For the first few times people play the game it is also
usually better to remove the Aces and the two Jokers. It is also usual
to play the game without any trumps suit until people are more familiar
with the idea.

### What should players do when they have an Ace card that says "invented a new X attack"?

The player can make up any attack they think is valid, but must match
the suit of the card e.g. data validation and encoding). With players
new to the game, it can be better to remove these to begin with.

### I don't understand what the attack means on each card - is there more detailed information?

Yes, the card browser on our website has more information on what each
card means. The website was created to help players understand the
attacks. See [cornucopia.owasp.org](https://cornucopia.owasp.org/cards).

## Getting Involved

![Cornucopia Card Authentication -
7](assets/images/Cornucopia-card-authentication-7.png){.fa-pull-right
style="padding:1em;background-color:#dddddd;margin:0 0 1em 2em;"}

Involvement in the development and promotion of Cornucopia is actively
encouraged! You do not have to be a security expert in order to
contribute. Some of the ways you can help are listed below.

### Localization

Are you fluent in another language? Can you help translate Cornucopia
into that language? Note this is a very large task due to the number of
documents involved, but the strings are now all available in textual
data files.

### Use and Promote the Cornucopia Card Decks

Please help raise awareness of Cornucopia by:

- Printing dcks of cards and giving them away
- Using Cornucopia with specifiers, architects, designers, developers,
  testers and others, in part to train them, but also to solicit
  feedback on their usability, practicality and appropriateness for
  their work
- Creating videos about how to play the game
- Developing a mobile app to play the game

### Feedback

![Cornucopia Card
Joker](assets/images/Cornucopia-card-joker-a.png){.fa-pull-right
style="padding:1em;background-color:#dddddd;margin:0 0 1em 2em;"}

Please use the friendly project [Google
Group](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/cornucopia-project)
for feedback:

- What do like?
- What don't you like?
- What cards don't make sense?
- How could the guidance be improved?
- What other decks would you like to see?

### Keep the Cards Updated

As the source referenced documents change, we have to update the decks.
You may also find errors and omissions. In the first instance, please
send a message to the project's [Google
Group](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/cornucopia-project)
if you have identified errors & omissions, have some time to maintain
the source documents, or can help in other ways.

### Create a New Deck

The first deck, Cornucopia Ecommerce Website Edition, has been renamed
Cornucopia Website App Edition and is currently available in six
languages. There is also a mobile app specific deck called Cornucopia
Mobile App Edition available in English only. Do you have an idea for
your own application security requirements card deck?
