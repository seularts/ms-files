An Application Security program is more successful when coverage of its
processes and tooling can be proven. Unfortunately, software inventory
lists consist of some custom-written applications for an organization
but also include systems and software that aren't in scope for a
traditional AppSec program (Active Directory or Adobe Reader, for
instance).

Making matters worse, organizations are constantly transforming the ways
they operate. New software is being written and deployed every day:

- Microservices
- Marketing sites
- Batch jobs
- New e-commerce features
- Mobile apps

Traditional ITAM solutions aren't tracking these custom-written
applications that are the lifeblood of your organization because they
aren't designed to find them.

If "who owns this?" or "did you know this was in production?" sounds
familiar, you're not alone.

# Jupiter Application Inventory Management System

![](assets/images/jupiter.png){align="left"}

What if we leveraged those DevOps processes to gather crucial
information about the organization's software applications?

\
\

## Defining Application

What is an application?

Asking that question to five different people will probably yield five
different answers. In terms of what the Jupiter Application Inventory
Management System considers an application, it can be thought of as a
singular module or code project unit that is built and deployed
independently (aside from data or operating environment dependencies).

Taking another step, an application has certain attributes. It has a
name. It has a codebase and thus a code repository. Where is that
repository? It might have a team that supports it and somebody who is
ultimately responsible for it. Who owns it? These are the types of
questions Jupiter helps to solve.

Data collected includes:

- Common Name: The most widely known or current name of the application
- Aliases: Other names the application might have or have had previously
- Description: A brief synopsis of the application's purpose for
  existing
- Code Repository URL: The location where the application's code is
  stored and versioned
- Binary Repository URL: The location where build artifacts are stored
  and versioned
- Primary Language: The most prominent programming language used in the
  application's codebase
- Secondary Languages: Additional programming languages used in the
  application's codebase
- Type: Applications might have a particular role inside of an
  application ecosystem, such as a microservice, user interface, batch
  job, etc.
- Primary Owner: A person who has ultimate responsibility for the
  direction or well-being of the application
- Secondary Owners: Other people who may be delegates of the Primary
  Owner
- Business Unit: Particularly important in large organizations, this is
  the specific group within the organization to which the application
  belongs
- Exposure: Applications have varying ways they can be exposed --
  internal to the organization, publicly available on the internet, or
  to a select group of users
- Number of Users: The number of users (or an estimate) of the
  application
- Data Classification: Many organizations have a data risk
  classification hierarchy and applications may fall into one of the
  categories
- Deployment Environment: Because the Collector captures information at
  the build and deployment stages, the specific environment to which the
  build is destined can be recorded (e.g. QA, UAT, Production, etc.)
- Deployment Environment URL: Correlating to the Deployment Environment,
  this is a URL for the application if it is a web application or
  service
- Risk Level: Many organizations have formal risk levels that determine
  prioritization of resources aside from data categorization (can be a
  factor of data classification and exposure)
- Regulations: Applicable regulations such as PCI, SOX, HIPPA, etc. can
  be listed
- Chat Channel: Many application development and support teams have a
  way to communicate with each other and to collaborate within their
  organization such as Slack or Glip
- Agile Scrum Board URL: Development teams often keep a list of their
  in-flight work and backlog in a project tracking system such as Jira
  or Redmine
- Build Server URL: The CI server from which the recorded build or
  deployment originated
- Age: Applications can have a long life and understanding a given
  application's age can help determine risk and gauge other implications
- Lifecycle Stage: Similar to age, an application can be New, in a
  Maintenance steady-state, or in Retirement
- Last Deployment Date: The last date on which the application was
  deployed

## High Level Design

![High-level Design](assets/images/hld.png)

First, the Jupiter Collector Service can gather primitive inventory data
(antecessors) directly from DevOps tools, such as continuous integration
servers like Jenkins via the Jupiter Collector Plugin, when the software
is built and deployed.

The Inventory Management Console connects to the collector service and
facilitates enrichment of the antecessor data into "gold records"
representing an application. These records are captured and stored
directly by the Curated Inventory Service via REST API or through the
Inventory Management Console.

## Inventory Management Console

The Inventory Management Console is a graphical web interface that
brings collection and curation of the inventory data together. This
user-friendly application can then help with creating projects in
application security tools, accelerating testing and assessment
activities.

## FAQ

Q: Why is this project named "Jupiter"?

A: In 2001: A Space Odyssey, the Discovery One embarked on a mission to
investigate the signal sent from the monolith on the Moon to Jupiter. In
2010: The Year We Make Contact, the crews of the Discovery and Leonov
witness countless monoliths emerge from Jupiter before it is converted
into a star. Aside from the cool sci-fi reference, there is an analog to
what this project is for -- to start with a small amount of information
about software applications in an organization's portfolio and build
upon that knowledge to find more.
