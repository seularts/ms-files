The OWASP Foundation today announced the availability of CycloneDX v1.6.
This significant release strengthens software supply chain security with
the introduction of two innovative capabilities: Cryptographic Bill of
Materials (CBOM), developed by IBM Research, and CycloneDX Attestations
(CDXA).

CycloneDX v1.6 builds upon the existing strengths of the CycloneDX
standard, which provides a machine-readable format for capturing the
components that comprise software (SBOM), hardware (HBOM), services
(SaaSBOM), and AI/ML models (AI/ML-BOM). CycloneDX builds upon a legacy
of innovation, empowering organizations to reduce risk and enhance
software and system transparency.

### **Cryptographic Bill of Materials (CBOM)**

As quantum computer performance improves, at some point in the future
they are expected to break many currently used cryptographic algorithms,
such as RSA. To address the issue, companies and organisations can
migrate their cryptographic assets to new post-quantum cryptographic
algorithms that have been selected by NIST for standardization.

The Cryptographic Bill of Materials (CBOM), developed by researchers and
software engineers at IBM, serves as a structured framework for
inventorying cryptographic assets. This approach is detailed in [OMB
M-23-02](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/M-23-02-M-Memo-on-Migrating-to-Post-Quantum-Cryptography.pdf)
and is particularly focused on preparing for the transition to
post-quantum cryptography (PQC). This preparation is underlined by the
issuance of [National Security Memorandum
10](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/04/national-security-memorandum-on-promoting-united-states-leadership-in-quantum-computing-while-mitigating-risks-to-vulnerable-cryptographic-systems/)
from the White House. CycloneDX v1.6 simplifies the discovery,
management, and reporting of cryptographic assets, laying the groundwork
for migration to quantum-safe systems and applications. It facilitates
the identification of weak cryptographic algorithms, promotes
cryptographic agility, and ensures compliance with evolving
cryptographic policies and advisories like [CNSA
2.0](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/07/2003071834/-1/-1/0/CSA_CNSA_2.0_ALGORITHMS_.PDF),
aligning with recommendations from NIST.

OWASP and the CycloneDX community would like to thank IBM Research for
developing CBOM.

"The introduction of our CBOM in CycloneDX 1.6 is a significant
milestone for managing the cryptography supply chain," said Michael
Osborne, CTO of IBM Quantum Safe. "CBOM is the first open standard to
describe an organizations' cryptographic assets inventory, and their
dependencies, giving organizations deeper visibility into the
cryptography they use, enabling them to assess their quantum readiness,
and to consider actionable steps towards becoming quantum safe."

### **CycloneDX Attestations (CDXA)**

CycloneDX Attestations are a modern capability for security compliance.
They enable organizations to communicate standards, claims, and evidence
in support of requirements, along with attestations to the veracity and
completeness of those claims.

"Modern software is tremendously complex, and ensuring compliance with
the dizzying array of standards is overwhelming," said Jeff Williams,
CTO of Contrast Security and the first Global Chair of OWASP. "CycloneDX
Attestations (CDXA) makes "*compliance as code*" possible with
machine-readable security standards and compliance documentation,
instead of endless PDFs, spreadsheets, and paper evidence. With CDXA,
you can automate production of compliance evidence, streamline
communication between all compliance stakeholders, facilitate
discussions about substantive security issues, handle exceptions, and
manage signatures. We're hoping CDXA marks the beginning of a new era
where compliance and security are not entirely different things."

### **Advancements to AI/ML Transparency**

Numerous other improvements are included in CycloneDX v1.6 including
environmental considerations which enhance CycloneDX's existing support
for AI/ML model cards. The incorporation of environmental data in
CycloneDX v1.6 transforms AI development, offering transparency into
energy usage and CO2 emissions across all stages, from training to
inference. This integration enables informed decision-making, fostering
sustainable technological practices. CycloneDX seamlessly integrates
environmental considerations into AI development, promoting harmony
between innovation and ecological preservation.

"Manifest relies on open SBOM formats not only for our internal
security, but to help customers of our SBOM-powered security platform
around the world." said Daniel Bardenstein, CTO and co-founder at
Manifest Cyber. "CycloneDX 1.6 is a significant step forward for the
global security community, unlocking both critical attestation workflows
as well as evolved transparency for machine learning. The enterprises we
support have been eagerly awaiting this release, and we look forward to
continued innovation and partnership from the OWASP CycloneDX community
well into the future."

### **CycloneDX 1.6's Journey Towards International Standardization** {#cyclonedx-16s-journey-towards-international-standardization}

This release underscores the commitment of the CycloneDX community to
fostering a collaborative and innovative environment. The OWASP
Foundation along with Ecma International have created an inclusive,
community-driven ecosystem for security standards development. This
collaboration empowers individuals to contribute their expertise and
insights, ensuring that standards like CycloneDX reflect the collective
wisdom of the global cybersecurity community. This effort is led by
[Ecma Technical Committee 54](https://tc54.org/) (TC54).

"Well-defined, standards-based, and interoperable SBOM formats are a key
building block for Bloomberg's secure use of open source software.
Bloomberg is very happy to see CycloneDX v1.6 on track to become an Ecma
International standard sometime in 2024, with ISO standardization
happening shortly thereafter," said web standards author Daniel
Ehrenberg, a software engineer with Bloomberg's JavaScript
Infrastructure & Tooling team and Vice President of Ecma International.
"Through deep technical review and community outreach, Ecma is working
to ensure that the definition of this format is transparent,
interoperable, and technically rigorous. We welcome everyone interested
to [join](https://ecma-international.org/about-ecma/join-ecma/) and
participate in this process. Ecma and OWASP are natural collaborators
due to our shared focus on engineer-led pragmatism, equality among
members, and openness."
