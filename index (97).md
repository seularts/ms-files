## What is OdTM?

OWASP Ontology-driven Threat Modelling (OdTM) framework is a set of
means for implementation of an ontological approach into automatic
threat modelling of computer systems.

### Description

The OdTM framework enables formalization of security related knowledge
(architectural components and associated threats and countermeasures) of
different computer system types (architectural domains) in form of
domain-specific threat models, or ontologies in the OWL (Web Ontology
language) format. That gives a useful way to collect the knowledge by
security professionals and share with software architects, developers
and users. Also, the framework allows to describe a computer system in
term of a domain-specific threat model with a DFD (data flow diagram),
and use automatic reasoning procedures to build a threat model (relevant
threats and countermeasures) of the system. Such a feature makes it
easily automation of the threat modelling process.

Our goals are:

- to maintain a base threat model (ontology) that enables creation of
  domain-specific threat models;
- to create different domain-specific threat models (for Web
  applications, Cloud computing, Internet of Things etc.);
- to develop an ontology-driven threat rule engine, and a GUI editor of
  domain-specific threat models.

### Roadmap

**Vision**: Involve the ontology-driven approach into automatic threat
modelling for collecting, sharing and usage of the strict
security-related knowledge through creation of domain-specific threat
models and development of software tools.

**Initial plan**:

- Milestone 1: To implement a threat rule engine (OdTM Server) as a
  remote JSON API service.
- Milestone 2: To develop various domain-specific threat models (the
  cloud computing domain as the first step).
- Milestone 3: To implement software modules, providing integration of
  OdTM Server with GUI threat modelling tools.
- Milestone 4: To implement a GUI editor of domain-specific threat
  models (OdTM Studio).

**Technology**: Knowledge engineering, OWL (Web Ontology Language),
Java, the OWL API library, the Jackson JSON library.
