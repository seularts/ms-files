## Injection Vulnerabilities

### [23rd May 2023 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-suffolk-chapter/events/291863605/) {#23rd-may-2023-virtual-event}

Location: virtual

Injection vulnerabilities remain a common problem today. A single
mistake could expose your whole database and customer data or give an
attacker the ability to remotely execute code on your server.

We will look at some examples of coding mistakes that can lead to
injection vulnerabilities and discuss how they could be mitigated.

This is a joint event provided by OWASP Bristol and OWASP Suffolk.

## Thinking like a Hacker

### [21st March 2023 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-suffolk-chapter/events/291864159/) {#21st-march-2023-virtual-event}

Location: virtual

Over the past few years OWASP Suffolk has been bringing you free events
to show you cyber security best practices. We discussed creating strong
passwords, patching and backing up, OSINT, API Security, SCA and RASP,
and many other subjects. In this event we hope to cement that knowledge
by showing you the view from the other side of the fence.

In this live interactive demonstration we will show you what a web
target looks like from the perspective of an attacker. With the use of a
vulnerable target that has not followed security best practices we will
show you just how easy it is for an attacker to gain access to your
computer, it's data and resources. With each step of the attack we will
demonstrate techniques and tools while discussing what could of been
done to mitigate each step of the attack.

By thinking like a Hacker and seeing your "defences" from their point of
view we hope to show you how important following cyber security best
practices really is.

Attendees of the OWASP Suffolk Fight Club events will be familiar with
the format of this event, except that this will be scripted with
interactive Q&A. The vulnerable target will be a virtual machine created
for the purpose of learning.

OSINT - OpenSource INTelligence is the art of research and analysis of
data that is freely available from publicly available sources. Combined
with digital tools and techniques it's amazing what you can learn using
nothing more than a computer and an internet connection.

This talk will:

- Introduce you to the world of OSINT
- Provide an overview of some of the techniques and resources used in
  OSINT
- Discuss how OSINT is being used today

Disclaimer: This talk is given for informative purposes only. Use of
OSINT tools and techniques for illegal activities is not condoned by
OWASP.

## Deepfakes: A Growing Cybersecurity Concern - Mike Warner

### [26th October 2022 (Virtual event)](%5bhttps_/www.meetup.com/owasp-suffolk-chapter/events/289044383/index.html) {#26th-october-2022-virtual-event}

Location: virtual

The talk:

Join us for a look at Deepfakes with Mike Warner, one of the OWASP
Dorset Chapter Leads.

Deepfakes; an emergent type of threat falling under the greater and more
pervasive umbrella of synthetic media, utilise a form of Artificial
Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) to create believable, realistic
videos, pictures, audio, and text of events which never happened.

Criminals are already starting to utilise deepfake technology to
impersonate executives' voices on phone calls and even their likenesses
over video to add an air of legitimacy to their attacks. As deepfakes
become more lifelike, phone calls, video chats and other forms of
communication will be more vulnerable to abuse.

This talk will look at the origins of Deepfake technology, how they
work, the threats and ethical quandaries they pose, and potential
mitigations, with a handful of demos.

This talk is hosted by OWASP Dorset and shared with OWASP Suffolk and
Bristol.

## What is eBPF and why should you care? - Kev Sheldrake

### [20th October 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-suffolk-chapter/events/288875196/) {#20th-october-2022-virtual-event}

The Talk:

eBPF is relatively new and "a revolutionary technology with origins in
the Linux kernel that can run sandboxed programs in an operating system
kernel." You can achieve similar results to writing a kernel module, but
in a (supposedly -- we'll come to that) safe manner. eBPF code runs in a
virtual machine and, depending on the program type, can access all sorts
of kernel internals, with programs being launched when specified code
points get hit.

I will talk about the basics and how to get up and running, the
challenges and pitfalls to overcome, a library I wrote when working at
Sysinternals to take away some of the pain, the Sysmon For Linux tool I
wrote for Sysinternals that logs events to Syslog, and Cilium/Tetragon
(and Cilium/ebpf library) that makes accessing eBPF for system
observability easier. I will discuss technical details and explain the
different use cases that might benefit you, from blue team using Sysmon
and Cilium/Tetragon to achieve super powerful abilities, to researchers
building custom program tracers, to red team exploiting kernel vulns, to
sysadmins seeking performance issues.

It is a truly exciting thing that everyone is talking about.

Bio: Kev Sheldrake is a security software engineer and researcher who
started working in the technical security field in 1997. Over the years,
Kev has been a developer and systems administrator of 'secure' systems,
an infosec policy consultant, a penetration tester, a reverse engineer
and an entrepreneur who founded and ran his own security consulting
company. He currently works at Isovalent on the open source and
enterprise versions of the system observability tool Tetragon, and in
the past he specialised in IoT, crypto, and tool development for a
number of years. Twitter: \@kevsecurity

The OWASP Nettacker project was created to automate information
gathering, vulnerability scanning, and in general to aid the penetration
testing engagements. Nettacker is able to run various scans using a
variety of methods and generate scan reports for applications and
networks, including services, bugs, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations,
default credentials and many other cool features - for example the
ability to chain different scan methods. This relatively new (Summer
2017) and a lesser-known OWASP project has generated a huge amount of
interest at BlackHat Europe 2018/2019 Arsenal live demo gathering
massive crowds of seasoned hackers and penetration testers eager to see
this new tool in action. This talk will showcase the OWASP Nettacker
project giving an overview of its features and including a live demo of
the tool.

## Patching and Backing-up

### [28th June 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/285923061/) {#28th-june-2022-virtual-event}

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

- **OWASP introduction and updates**
- \*\*The talk - Patching and Backing-up \*\*
- **Q&A**

The Talk:

Every day we hear more and more about computers being compromised by
malicious actors or malware. Ransomware is on the rise, WordPress and
other CMS sites are constantly being hit as this or that plug-in is
exploited. What can we as individuals or small businesses do to protect
our computers, web sites and data?

In this talk we will discuss patching and backing-up shown from both the
perspective of the individual / small business owner and that of a
malicious actor.

From the perspective of the individual or small business we will suggest
best practices around patching and backing-up. Covering both open-source
and commercial solutions we will show you ways to improve your security
position by keeping your software fully patched employing techniques
taken from OS hardening and the splitting of backing-up into data
back-ups and system imaging.

From the perspective of the malicious actor we will show you how your
computers can be scanned for weaknesses and then exploited with little
effort using tools such as nmap, Nikto, WPscan, MetaSploit and
SearchSploit covering the ExploitDB and the lifecycle of a CVE.

This talk will cover the following:

- Patching and backing-up strategies for the individual and small
  business owner
- Employing OS hardening techniques to reduce attack vectors and to
  speed-up backing-up
- Open-source and Commerical backup solutions for Windows, Linux, Mac
  and popular website CMS such as WordPress, Drupal and Joomla!
- Demonstration of how malicious actors can scan your computers for
  known vulnerabilities and easily exploit unpatched software that you
  are running
- The lifecycle of a CVE
- Limiting the risks of Ransomware

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

- **OWASP introduction and updates**
- **The talk - Log4J - Past, Present, and Future**
- **Q&A**

The Talk:

The log4j incident shocked the world back in December - but by
implementing the proper protocols and tools early-on organizations can
be better prepared moving forward. Logs, metrics, security, and metrics
can be your secret weapon when it comes to the observability of your
applications and software. But are you using all of your data sources to
their full potential?

We'll go over what organizations should keep in mind before, during, and
post-security vulnerabilities (based on the log4j incident) when it
comes to their monitoring tools and how powerful insights can be pulled
to avoid delayed crisis management.

## Securing your Machine Learning solutions and protecting your models - Phil Basford

### [3rd May 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/285087125/) {#3rd-may-2022-virtual-event}

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

- **OWASP introduction and updates**
- **The talk - Securing your Machine Learning solutions and protecting
  your models**
- **Q&A**

The Talk:

Machine Learning is increasingly being used by companies as a disruptor
or providing a USP. This means that Machine Learning models need to cope
with being a critical part of solutions and if those solutions use
PCI-DSS or PII then the models must be highly secure.

In addition, if a Machine Learning model is part of your USP then you
will want to protect it. Also, the EU AI Regulation and UK AI Strategy
means that AI is becoming increasingly regulated. This means you need
able to prove what model made a prediction and why it made it by
providing auditability and explainabilty.

In this talk we go over these issues and how to address them including
using AWS and how to implement development best practices.

About the speaker:

Phil Basford is one of the Ipswich AWS User Group Leaders and
contributes to the AWS Community by speaking at a number of summits,

## Are We Secure? - Jeff Williams

### [26th April 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/284899658/) {#26th-april-2022-virtual-event}

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

- **OWASP introduction and updates**
- **The talk - Are we Secure?**
- **Q&A**

The Talk:

We all trust software with the most important aspects of our life... but
it's a blind trust with virtually no justification. Actually, by almost
any measure, application security has been failing for 20 years.
Software is still riddled with vulnerabilities and gets attacked
thousands of times a month -- mostly undetected. Yet instead of trying
different approaches, we mostly keep pushing the same futile and
expensive practices harder.

In this talk, we'll discuss why the underlying asymmetric information
problem in the software market makes it impossible to make progress. And
we'll talk about how we can escape this trap, change the software
market, and make software trustworthy for everyone.

About the speaker:

## All about Passwords

### [12th April 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/284467213/) {#12th-april-2022-virtual-event}

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

- **OWASP introduction and updates**
- **All about Passwords**
- **Q&A**

Love them or hate them, passwords have become part of our daily life. We
use them to sign into just about everything, from our devices to emails,
social media, cloud services and digital banking. We have to remember
different passwords for each site we need to log-in to, and we are
forced to change them on occasion. It can be a lot to remember. Password
Managers can help and 2FA or MFA can provide extra security. Yet despite
all that, service providers can still be compromised and our carefully
chosen passwords can end up somewhere on the darkweb being sold by the
hundred thousand.

Making use of both slides and live demonstrations Martin and David will
take you through a brief history of passwords, discussing password
lengths and formats, password policies, guidelines and best practices,
the storage and transmission of passwords, 2FA and MFA, and pretty much
everything you ever wanted to know about passwords. All in under an
hour.

Throughout the talk we will employ a Red vs Blue format with Martin
playing Blue, discussing best practices and how to keep your logins
protected. While David will be playing Red, discussing the techniques
and tools employed by malicious actors in an attempt to secure access to
your logins.

## The best practices of working securely on AWS - Alex Kearns

### [29th March 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/283317246/) {#29th-march-2022-virtual-event}

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

- **OWASP introduction and updates**
- **The talk - The best practices of working securely on AWS**
- **Q&A**

The Talk:

Cloud has been around for a relatively long time now, yet there doesn't
seem to be a huge community of purely security focused individuals
working with it. My theory is that this is down to cloud security
appearing to be so different to what people are used to working with.
Let's try and bust that myth.

Join me for a bird's eye view of the most important security concepts on
AWS, what the best practices are around them as well as what AWS can do
to help make life easier. I hope that this talk makes some of you more
comfortable exploring AWS in the future.

About Alex:

Alex Kearns is a consultant at Inawisdom in Ipswich delivering data and
AI/ML solutions on AWS for a variety of customers. Prior to this he has
worked for an early stage startup and BT in a security focused role. He
has a firm belief that security best practices should underpin all
workloads, especially those in public clouds such as AWS.

## A Swiss Knife for API Security and Legal Risk Management - Dr Baljeet Malhotra

### [10th March 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/283912021/) {#10th-march-2022-virtual-event}

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

- **OWASP updates**
- **The talk - A Swiss Knife for API Security and Legal Risk
  Management**

The Talk:

Web applications are prone to various cybersecurity risks. Did you know
that 96% of these web applications contain some Open Source?
Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some web
APIs. You may be surprised to know that web APIs contribute 83% of the
traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also
means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations
immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models,
competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively
impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business
disruptions, legal and compliance issues. In 2022, API abuses are
predicted to be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data
breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital
transformation at organizations it is imperative for their Security,
Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage
various API related risks.

This session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for
effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero
Trust model that enterprises can use as a "Swiss Knife" for reducing
their API related risks. We'll also highlight best practices and
hands-on examples for API Risk Management.

About Dr Baljeet Malhotra:

## OWASP Juice Shop demonstration

### [22nd February 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/283567353/) {#22nd-february-2022-virtual-event}

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

- **OWASP introduction and updates**
- **Live demo of OWASP Juice Shop**

So you want to have a go at ethical hacking but you don't know where to
start?

In under an hour Dave, Wojciech and Martin will walk you through
installing, setting up and attacking OWASP Juice Shop from the comfort
of your own home.

OWASP Juice Shop is a free insecure web application that you can install
on your own computer. It's a popular security training tool riddled with
security issues like SQL injection, XSS and security misconfigurations.
Using gamification Juice Shop acts as an e-commerce website that you can
legally attack on your own computer.

Juice Shop has built-in tutorials and comes with 100 challenges for you
to find and exploit. With each challenge you solve your score increases
on the scoreboard. But wait, where is the scoreboard? That's your very
first challenge, to find the scoreboard hidden within the application.
As you progress Juice Shop awards you points and displays your progress.
Challenges are ranked by difficulty.

After walking you through installation and setup we will have an
interactive session where we demo how to find the scoreboard and
complete a few of the easy challenges.

## Discussion: Getting started in Ethical Hacking

### [18th January 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/283069487/) {#18th-january-2022-virtual-event}

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

- **Welcome back & overview of what we have in store for 2022**
- **OWASP updates**
- **Open discussion on how to get started in Ethical Hacking**

Getting started in Ethical Hacking can seem daunting. There is so much
information out there, so many websites, tools, YouTube videos, courses,
etc etc. Where do you start? Do you have to do a course or be certified?
Do I need to set up my own testing lab, and if so, what operating system
and tools do I use? Is there a way to learn for free? So many questions.
It can feel so overwhelming at times, enough to put you off.

The aim of this event is to offer an open discussion where we can all
share tips, tricks, resources and suggestions around how to go about
getting started in Ethical Hacking. Everything from how to make learning
fun, recommended resources such as websites, podcasts, gamification
sites (CTFs), tools, bug bounty platforms and tips and tricks on how to
learn and remain focused.

This event will be open to members of OWASP Suffolk and other OWASP
groups. This event will not be recorded.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Misconfigurations

### [2nd December 2021 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/282025399/) {#2nd-december-2021-virtual-event}

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

- **OWASP updates**
- **The talk**
- **Open discussion**

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) makes deploying cloud or container
configurations scalable and faster. If you are launching a microservice
into a Kubernetes cluster, or even building an entire AWS virtual
infrastructure, IaC can automate the deployment. By building repeatable
templates you can also ensure that deployments happen exactly as you
design, every time. However, errors in infrastructure configuration are
now regarded as the second biggest cause of data breaches. There are
many ways to give adversaries an advantage through security
misconfigurations. Overly permissive storage volumes, unauthenticated
database access, or ports left open to the internet have all been a
cause of compromise. The solution? Treat your infrastructure code the
same as your application code. During your build process, use tools to
scan for infrastructure misconfigurations. When you find them raise
alerts or even break the build.

In this session, we will discuss common types of IaC misconfigurations,
and demonstrate a free, open-source security tool that developers can
build into their pipelines to help protect infrastructure from
compromise.

certification on her own. While at OccamSec, she has led and has been a
part of a variety of offensive engagements in the realms of cyber and
physical security (security/penetration testing of applications,
network/physical infrastructure and systems) as well as risk assessment
(architecture/policy review, vulnerability assessment, and employee
interviews). Finding crucial fault points in an organization's
infrastructure while also adapting to the ever changing demands of the
clients she works with.

- **Ivano Bianco**

Italian, with a fake Russian accent. Started using computers at the
tender age of 11, by the age of 14 he switched from the BASIC language
to Assembly and started to circumvent copy protections for fun. Spent
the next 20 years working in IT Operations, keeping systems secure and
automating deployments before job titles like "IT Security Engineer" and
"DevOps Engineer" were a thing.

Had the opportunity to cover technical hands-on roles for a multitude of
SME and multinational companies such as: - Société Générale - H3G -
Ericsson - Global Payments -- Puppet.

Nowadays he prefers to focus on penetration testing, web application
testing (because breaking things is always fun), threat hunting and
security awareness training. He still likes to figure out why a server
is down, but will not fix your computer.

- **Nicholas Donarski**

Has been a pioneer in the Information Security field for over 20 years.
During this time, he's worked with a diverse client list which includes

- **Living In A World of Zero Trust - Vandana Verma** \[
  [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Hs7JPRjgg) \]

  As now everything is moving to cloud, all the applications are
  accessible from anywhere and everywhere. However, No one wants their
  private information to be compromised and openly available for the
  world. We have been taking so many precautions, however breaches
  continue to happen. How should we fix this?

  Organisations have been talking about Zero Trust lately and this has
  become a buzzword. The talk will explore Zero Trust beyond the
  buzzword and describe what exactly is Zero Trust and why it is so
  important to keep organisations safe. How can we implement or deploy
  Zero Trust in an organisation while keeping the current and future
  state of an organization in mind. What should be the business model to
  move any organisation towards Zero Trust Architecture and what all
  policies need to be implemented to achieve the same. \#### Speakers

Vandana has over 14 years of experience and comes from strong
application security background and has been working on Cloud Security,
Application security, Vulnerability assessment, secure code review,
threat profiling and remediation support for web/client server

- **how to prevent Dev from committing secrets and credentials into git
  repositories - Abhinav Sejpal** \[
  [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESGZ_Di7CtM) \]

  Sensitive information such as the AWS keys, access tokens, SSH keys
  etc. are often erroneously leaked via the public source code
  repositories due to accidental git commits. This can be avoided by
  using pre-commit hooks like "Talisman" which checks for sensitive
  information in the files before commits or push activity.

  [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/owaspsuffolk/practical-threat-analysis-martin-russ)
  \]\[ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lI4ZJom3u0) \]

  Martin Russ shows you how to actually do Threat Analysis using a
  simple spreadsheet as a guide. The key to successful threat analysis
  and modelling is to have a clear idea of how to get to the end-point,
  and not to get overwhelmed with how you are going to get there! Having
  a simple guide makes this much easier, but there aren't many examples
  out there - this turns to be one of those rare topics where Google
  searches don't return much that is particularly useful. So we will be
  using a very straight-forward approach that isn't scary or hard to
  understand, and which doesn't require a brain the size of a planet. or
  the services of an expensive consultant!

#### Speakers

- Martin Russ passed the CISSP exam in just over four hours (you are
  allowed to take six!), but has just lapsed and returned to the status
  of mere mortal. He worked in the Security Engineering department of a
  major US utility metering company for nearly ten years, and knows too
  much about hacking devices that measure, or web front-ends that
  interface to the real world, or cloud back-ends that assume that
  replication is a substitute for backups... He has always wanted a
  t-shirt that says: 'There's no way that could ever happen...' because
  he has heard it too many times in security workshops...

  Servers are the root of all web apps and sites, it's the central point
  that your clients/customers will connect to and where you put your
  code. Many small and under resource companies that do there own
  hosting don't normally put the time and investment in there hosting
  technology and this is where it starts to go wrong. This talk will
  discuss what some of the dangers are and what could happen if an
  attacker gets into your infrastructure, we will also talk about how
  some simple changes to the infrastructure can reduce the risk of being
  attacked.

<!-- -->

- **Discussion about future of OWASP Suffolk**

  We will have open discussion about what we are doing, and what YOU
  expecting us to do.

- **Windows Active Directory Security Lowlights - Barry Myles**

  Once an attacker is inside your organisation they very often will
  misuse Windows Active Directory for almost total compromise of every
  aspect of an organisation's computing infrastructure and the data it
  holds. This talk will describe how an attacker might do this, when
  they have done so in the past, the kinds of tools they would use, what
  common mistakes enable this, and how organisations could go about
  defending themselves both through changes in behaviour and changes to
  their setup.

#### Speakers

- Barry Myles leads an internal penetration testing team at BT, although
  tries to stay away from very traditional views of pen testing as much
  as possible. After becoming somewhat bored and jaded with project
  management work in 2006 he decided the life on an attacker was a very
  much more fun, but perhaps less constructive way of life. He enjoys
  large scale scanning, reverse engineering, cryptography, hardware
  hacking and network protocols a bit too much.

- **Understanding how to prevent Sensitive Data Exposure - Simon
  Greatrix** \[
  [](https://ubiquitous-adventure-gnwnz4m.pages.github.io/Owaspsuffollk-20190319.pdf)[PDF](https://www.slideshare.net/owaspsuffolk/understanding-how-to-prevent-sensitive-data-exposure)
  \] \[ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1nNq3wt7Bg) \]

  Sensitive data is often the target of any attack, and its exposure has
  the greatest risk of long-term damage. OWASP and the PCI DSS provide
  many recommendations. The internet provides even more. These can be
  hard to understand, hard to implement, and contradictory. I will be
  sharing my understanding of how the cryptographic algorithms work and
  how they should best be used.

#### Speakers

- Dr Simon Greatrix has been writing software since the late 70s and has
  worked as a security expert for e-commerce for nearly 20 years. He is
  currently working on SETL's block chain product. Java has been his
  preferred programming language since 1996.
