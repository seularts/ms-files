## The OWASP Product Security Capability Framework (PSCF)

This is the **OWASP framework** for building security capabilities into
your product delivery process and teams.

The main website for the PSCF is on [Prods.ec](https://prods.ec/) and
includes many more details about the Framework along with explanatory
videos.

We created the Product Security Capability Framework to provide a clear
way of thinking about software product security and the delivery
activities that lead to building and maintaining the right level of
security for your customers and your organisation.

This framework is designed to be the foundation of:

- Your point-in-time appraisals of current security capability
- The security policy defining how your organisation works to build
  secure products
- Your strategic product security programme for continuous improvement

The framework currently consists of six (6) process areas and thirty-two
(32) capabilities.

\

The current 1.0 version of the framework is available
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GiQSePaFkY-wFj3RP3VUkZA81Pqzyhn9x78fSL2OTk8/edit#gid=0)
in Google Sheets and anyone with can comment and contribute there.

The Sheet allows someone to do an assessment of their own organisation's
capabilities and get a report.
