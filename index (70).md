SamuraiWTF (Web Training Framework) is not just another vulnerable
application - it's a complete, robust framework for learning application
security testing. It's a project of OWASP (Open Web Application Security
Project) and is designed to help individuals boost their cyber security
skills. The framework is based on an Ubuntu-based basebox, making it
fairly lightweight and easy to manage.

SamuraiWTF is a build system made up of multiple projects. It is best
known for building a virtual machine that has been pre-configured to
function as a web penetration testing and training environment. This
environment is supported on Hyper-V, VirtualBox, and VMWare. It is built
using Vagrant and Ansible to provide the most cross-platform mechanism
to build and enhance the learning environment.

# Katana

Katana is the package management tool and interface for SamuraiWTF 5.0+.
Specifically Katana is intended to be used by instructors to set up a
classroom lab that will be distrubuted to their students, or by
self-study students to install the tools and targets they desire to use.

*IMPORTANT NOTES:*

- *Katana runs as root. It is intended only to be used in a temporary
  classroom environment. Don't install it on any network that is
  important to you.*
- *Katana is installed as part of the [SamuraiWTF
  Distribution](https://github.com/SamuraiWTF/samuraiwtf) and is not
  intended to be installed or run on a non-SamuraiWTF build.*

## Using Katana

There are two ways to use Katana:

### Using Katana with the Web User Interface {#using-katana-with-the-web--user-interface}

By default, Katana should be running at
`http://katana.wtf`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge} from within
your SamuraiWTF environment. Simply visit the Katana URL from any web
browser inside the environment. From the. GUI you will be able to
install, stop, and start any of the Katana-defined tools and targets.
Note that an internet connection is required to install tools and
targets.

### Using Katana from the Command Line

From a command line terminal inside your SamuraiWTF environment, simply
type katana and the desired arguments. Katana supports the following
arguments:

  Argument                                                   Description
  ---------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `list`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}             List all available modules that are currently supported by Katana.
  `install <name>`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}   Install the supplied module by name.
  `remove <name>`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}    Remove the supplied module by name.
  `start <name>`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}     Start the supplied module, assuming it is startable.
  `stop <name>`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}      Stop the supplied module, assuming it is stopable.
  `status <name>`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}    Output the status of the supplied module. This will include whether or not it is installed and if it is running (if it is runnable).
  `lock`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}             Lock the current set of modules. This will require a restart of Katana.
  `--update`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}         This is a special argument for updating katana to the latest version from this repo. For development purposes, an optional second parameter to pull from a specific branch.

## Samurai-Dojo

Samurai-Dojo is a set of vulnerable web applications created by and for
the Samurai security training and testing distributions like SamuraiSTFU
and SamuraiWTF. These vulnerable applications include:

- Dojo Basic: A simple PHP app that can be used for demos and exercises
- Dojo Scavenger: A student CTF-like challenge to test pentesting skills

### Vagrant

For ease of development a Vagrant configuration are available. The
Vagrant configuration and deployment are stored in the following files:

- `Vagrantfile`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge} : contains a
  standard Vagrant config (no plugins required)
- `bootstrap.sh`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge} : contains the
  installation script to get Samurai-Dojo up and running on Apache

## Development

The SamuraiWTF project team is currently rewriting dojo-basic. This
effort is to modify the project codebase to be a complete modern
application. It is being worked on in the
[dojo-basic-2](https://github.com/SamuraiWTF/dojo-basic-2) repo.
