![OWASP DSOMM Logo](assets/images/logotype.png) From a startup to a
multinational corporation the software development industry is currently
dominated by agile frameworks and product teams and as part of it DevOps
strategies. It has been observed that during the implementation,
security aspects are usually neglected or are at least not sufficient
taken account of. It is often the case that standard safety requirements
of the production environment are not utilized or applied to the build
pipeline in the continuous integration environment with containerization
or concrete docker. Therefore, the docker registry is often not secured
which might result in the theft of the entire company's source code.

The DevSecOps Maturity Model, which is presented in the talk, shows
security measures which are applied when using DevOps strategies and how
these can be prioritized. With the help of DevOps strategies security
can also be enhanced. For example, each component such as application
libraries and operating system libraries in docker images can be tested
for known vulnerabilities. Attackers are intelligent and creative,
equipped with new technologies and purpose. Under the guidance of the
forward-looking DevSecOps Maturity Model, appropriate principles and
measures are at hand implemented which counteract the attacks.
