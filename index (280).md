potential of what Cross Site Scripting (XSS) can lead to. BeEF can be

unsuspecting victims. Being aware of these attacks and how they work can
help developers better prepare and defend against them.

BSides SF is fast approaching! Who's going?

This month we talked about a number of modern web security patterns.
Like how to add Subresource Integrity (SRI) checking to your external
resources. Ways you can enable Content Security Policies (CSP) and
reporting on CSPs. What to expect from Expect Certificate Transparency
(Expect-CT) and Certificate Authorization Authorities (CAAs). Then we
wrapped it up with how to set up a `security.txt`{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge} on your site with the securitytxt
[proposal](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt).
There's also a generator found at https://securitytxt.org

Come join us for the inaugural event of the Sacramento OWASP Chapter. We
have so much AppSec, NetSec, and InfoSec talent in the Sacramento area
that it's time we form a community for us to share our thoughts,
experiences, and best practices.

The Sacramento OWASP chapter has been dormant for a while and it's time
to give it a jump start. This will be our first official meeting. Come
by, say hello, put a face to a name, and maybe let us know what you're
interested in learning or even contributing!

Please RSVP by October 15th so we can accommodate seating, snacks, and
drinks.
