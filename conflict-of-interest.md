Adopted by the Board of Directors on September 25, 2024

## Applicability and Summary

This Conflict of Interest Policy (the "Policy") applies to all
participants, members, staff and members of the Board of Directors (the
"Board") of The OWASP Foundation ("OWASP). By participating in OWASP
activities, each individual doing so (each a "Participant") agrees to
comply with this Policy.

Failure to comply with this Policy can have significant implications for
OWASP and its Participants (even Participants who are in compliance with
the Policy), including but not limited to jeopardizing OWASP's tax
exempt status, potential sanctions against those failing to comply,
unnecessary delays, costs and expenses for OWASP and its Participants,
rejection, discontinuation or changes to OWASP work, activities, or
decisions, or requirements to repay amounts paid in conflict or interest
situations.

Critical aspects of this Policy include the following:

- Declare all perceived or actual conflicts of interest
- Manage actual and perceived conflicts of interest by stepping away
  from associated discussions and decision-making, and making required
  disclosures in accordance with this Policy
- If in doubt about whether something constitutes a conflict of
  interest, disclose and ask for advice.

Note: Conflicts of interest (even if only perceived) may reflect
adversely upon OWASP, the person(s) involved, and/or the institutions
with which they are affiliated. Certain conflicts (or failure to
disclose such conflicts) may involve fraudulent or otherwise illegal
conduct, and may put you or OWASP at legal risk.

## ARTICLE I

### PURPOSES

This Policy has been adopted by the Board to protect the interests of
OWASP when it is contemplating entering into transactions or
arrangements that might benefit the private interest of an Interested
Person (defined below), or which might result in a possible transaction
inconsistent with OWASP's tax exempt legal status or applicable law
involving an Interested Person, including but not limited to so-called
"excess benefit transactions." Any of the foregoing could potentially
jeopardize OWASP's tax exempt status, and even the appearance of
conflicts (where no actual conflict exists) can have negative
consequences for OWASP and others involved.

Every OWASP director, principal officer, member of a committee with
Board delegated powers, or employee owes a duty of loyalty to OWASP and
must carry out their responsibilities honestly and transparently while
ensuring they avoid any conflict of interest or the appearance of a
conflict of interest with OWASP. The duty of loyalty generally requires
a person to prefer the interests of OWASP over their own interests or
the interests of others when making decisions affecting OWASP, and to
avoid acts of self-dealing.

The purpose of this Policy is to educate Interested Persons and others
on what may constitute a conflict of interest, to assist Interested
Persons in identifying and disclosing potential conflicts of interest,
and to help ensure the avoidance of conflicts of interest wherever
possible. This Policy is also intended to help ensure transparency and
that the actions of OWASP can clearly serve the OWASP mission. This
Policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable laws
governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit and tax-exempt
organizations. In the event of an inconsistency between the requirements
and procedures prescribed in this Policy and those existing under
applicable laws, such laws shall prevail.

## ARTICLE II

### DEFINITIONS

#### 2.1 Interested Person {#21-interested-person}

"Interested Person" means any director, principal officer, member of a
committee with Board delegated powers, or employee of OWASP who has a
Financial Interest (defined below).

#### 2.2 Financial Interest {#22-financial-interest}

"Financial Interest" means any of the following, to the extent held
directly or indirectly by the person in question, whether through
business, investment, Family Member, or otherwise:

1.  An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which OWASP
    has a transaction or arrangement,
2.  A compensation arrangement with OWASP or with any entity or
    individual with which OWASP has a transaction or arrangement, or
3.  A potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation
    arrangement with, any entity or individual with which OWASP is
    negotiating a transaction or arrangement.

The term "compensation" includes remuneration as well as gifts or favors
that are not insubstantial.

The term "Family Member" includes a person's spouse, child (natural or
adopted) or step-child, parent or step-parent, in-law (father, mother,
brother or sister in-law), grandchild, grandparent, brother, sister or
half/step brother or sister, and any person with whom such person or
such person's Family Member shares living quarters under circumstances
that closely resemble a marital relationship or who is financially
dependent on such person.

A Financial Interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest. Under
Article III, Section 2, a person who has a Financial Interest may have a
conflict of interest only if the Board (or an OWASP committee to which
the Board has delegated authority to make such determination (each a
"Conflict Committee") determines that a conflict of interest exists.

## ARTICLE III

### PROCEDURES

#### 3.1 Duty to Disclose {#31-duty-to-disclose}

In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an
Interested Person must disclose the existence of the Financial Interest
and all associated material facts to the Board and, if applicable, the
members of the applicable Conflict Committee.

#### 3.2 Third Party Disclosure {#32-third-party-disclosure}

All Board members, employees, community members, and others are
encouraged to notify the Board if they become aware or any undisclosed
Financial Interest or other conflict of interest (and associated
material facts) on the part of any Interested Person.

#### 3.3 Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists {#33-determining-whether-a-conflict-of-interest-exists}

In the event the Board becomes aware of any actual or perceived conflict
of interest, the Board shall first determine whether to delegate
determination as to whether a conflict of interest exists to an
applicable Conflict Committee, after which, the Board (or such Conflict
Committee) shall hold a meeting to discuss the matter with the
applicable Interested Person(s), and such Interested Person(s) may make
a corresponding presentation.

After disclosure of the Financial Interest and associated material facts
to the Board (and/or applicable Conflict Committee) and after any such
discussion with the Interested Person, the Interested Person shall leave
the Board (or if applicable, Conflict Committee) meeting, and the Board
(or if applicable, Conflict Committee) shall discuss, determine, and
vote upon whether a conflict of interest exists. If the Board (or if
applicable, the Conflict Committee) determines that no conflict of
interest exists, the transaction or arrangement that was the subject of
the aforementioned disclosures may proceed (subject to any other process
required by this Policy).

#### 3.4 Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest {#34-procedures-for-addressing-the-conflict-of-interest}

1.  If the Board (or if applicable, the Conflict Committee) determines
    that a conflict of interest does exist, then the Chair of the Board
    (or of the Conflict Committee if applicable) shall, if appropriate,
    appoint a person (other than an Interested Person) or committee
    (that does not include Interested Persons) to investigate
    alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement subject to
    such conflict of interest.
2.  After exercising due diligence, the Board (or if applicable,
    Conflict Committee) shall determine whether OWASP can obtain with
    reasonable efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement
    from a person or entity that would not give rise to a conflict of
    interest.
3.  If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably
    possible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest,
    the Board (or such Conflict Committee, if applicable) shall
    determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors whether
    the transaction or arrangement that is subject to such conflict of
    interest is nonetheless in OWASP's best interest, for its own
    benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable to OWASP. In
    conformity with the above determination, it shall make its decision
    as to whether to enter into such transaction or arrangement.

#### 3.5 Violations of the Conflict of Interest Policy {#35-violations-of-the-conflict-of-interest-policy}

1.  If the Board (or a committee designated by the Board to make such
    determination) has reasonable cause to believe a Participant has
    failed to disclose any actual or possible conflict of interest, it
    shall inform the Participant of the basis for such belief and afford
    the Participant an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to
    disclose.
2.  If, after hearing the Participant's response and after making
    further investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the Board
    or such committee determines the Participant has failed to disclose
    an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall take
    appropriate disciplinary and corrective action. Any violation of
    this Policy is a serious matter and may constitute cause for removal
    from the Board, termination or suspension of OWASP membership or
    participation, termination of employment by OWASP, and/or the
    termination of any contractual relationship OWASP may have with an
    Interested Person or other party.

## ARTICLE IV

### RECORDS OF PROCEEDINGS

#### 4.1 Minutes {#41-minutes}

In connection with matters relating to this Policy, the minutes of the
Board and all committees with board delegated powers hereunder shall
contain:

1.  The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to
    have a Financial Interest in connection with an actual or possible
    conflict of interest, the nature of the Financial Interest, any
    action taken to determine whether a conflict of interest was
    present, and the Board's or such committee's decision as to whether
    a conflict of interest in fact existed.
2.  The names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes
    relating to the transaction or arrangement, the content of the
    discussion, including any alternatives to the proposed transaction
    or arrangement, and a record of any votes taken in connection with
    the proceedings.

## ARTICLE V

### COMPENSATION

5.1 A voting member of the Board who receives compensation, directly or
indirectly, from OWASP for services is precluded from voting on matters
pertaining to that member's compensation.

5.2 A voting member of any OWASP committee whose jurisdiction includes
compensation matters and who receives compensation, directly or
indirectly, from OWASP for services is precluded from voting on matters
pertaining to that member's compensation.

5.3. No voting member of the Board or any such committee who receives
compensation, directly or indirectly, from OWASP, either individually or
collectively, is prohibited from providing information to any committee
regarding compensation.

## ARTICLE VI

### ANNUAL STATEMENTS

Each OWASP director, principal officer, member of a committee with
governing board delegated powers, and employee shall annually sign a
statement which affirms such person:

1.  Has read, understands, and agrees to comply with the Policy, and
2.  Understands that OWASP is a charitable organization and to maintain
    its federal tax exemption it must engage primarily in activities
    which accomplish one or more of its tax-exempt purposes.

## ARTICLE VII

### PERIODIC REVIEWS

To ensure OWASP operates in a manner consistent with charitable purposes
and does not engage in activities that could jeopardize its tax-exempt
status, periodic reviews shall be conducted. The periodic reviews shall,
at a minimum, include the following subjects:

1.  Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based
    on competent survey information and the result of arm's length
    bargaining.
2.  Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with
    management corporations conform to OWASP's written policies, are
    properly recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for
    goods and services, further charitable purposes and do not result in
    inurement, impermissible private benefit or in an excess benefit
    transaction.

## ARTICLE VIII

### USE OF OUTSIDE EXPERTS

When conducting the periodic reviews as provided for in Article VII,
OWASP may, but need not, use outside advisors. If outside experts are
used, their use shall not relieve the Board of its responsibility for
ensuring periodic reviews are conducted. The Vice Chair and Executive
Director are jointly responsible for annual periodic reviews to be
conducted and presented to the Board by the end of Q4 each year.
