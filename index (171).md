## Overview

Cross-tenant vulnerabilities are a new type of security risk that is
characteristic of cloud-based applications. Such bugs can enable
malicious tenants to break security boundaries, escape tenant isolation
and access other tenants' data. The goal of this project is to create
highly practical guidance for cloud developers to manage the risk of
isolation escape by ensuring proper implementation of strong security
boundaries, and thereby mitigate potential cross-tenant vulnerabilities
in their SaaS/PaaS applications.

## Description

The goals of this project:

1.  Create a list of common security mistakes in PaaS and SaaS solutions
    which could enable cross-tenant vulnerabilities, such as
    misconfigured containers, overly permissive firewall rules, lack of
    data hygiene, etc.
2.  Write best practices specific to each major cloud provider (AWS,
    Azure and GCP) to help developers avoid making such mistakes in
    their application architecture.
3.  Develop example architecture diagrams and Terraform files
    representing secure applications which implement strong mitigations
    against cross-tenant vulnerabilities.
