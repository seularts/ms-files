The Common Lifecycle Enumeration (CLE) is an open standard supporting
component aliasing, component lifecycle changes such as end-of-life and
end-of-support, and provenance chaining over time.

## Introduction

Despite years of development in standards for communicating software
component vulnerabilities, there is a notable lack of standardized
communication for lifecycle events of software or hardware components.
Lifecycle events include instances such as the cessation of active
development, discontinuation of sales, or the end of security updates.
Crucially, events altering the software identifier, as elaborated in the
Component Aliasing section, are also significant.

The absence of a standardized way of communicating lifecycle events for
software or hardware components has significant implications,
particularly in regards to security and maintenance. For example, once a
component reaches its end-of-life, it no longer receives security
updates. Determining when components reach such milestones remains
challenging, potentially exposing security vulnerabilities.

## Work in Progress

The CLE project is collecting [use
cases](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sRMS1IX0r7ZkYthDR0VY1bYyvp_6K_xw4sR1vZwla8E/edit)
and will be working with the community to create a specification that
can achieve said use cases. Conversations have historically taken place
in the OWASP CycloneDX Slack workspace, however, a dedicated [Slack
channel](https://owasp.slack.com/archives/C06GUKY03NC) is now available
on the OWASP Slack workspace.

## Get Involved

Like all OWASP projects, CLE is open for everyone to participate in. You
do not need to be an OWASP member to make a difference. If you'd like to
get involved, review and optionally comment on the use cases document
and introduce yourself and what you'd like to work on in the Slack
channel. Together, we can make CLE a reality.
