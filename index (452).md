## Welcome

OWASP Chandigarh is the Chandigarh chapter of "OWASP -- Open Web
Application Security Project", a community focused on building a
knowledge-sharing platform for cybersecurity enthusiasts. The chapter
brings together professionals, students, and hobbyists passionate about
ethical hacking, information security, and cybersecurity.

OWASP Chandigarh hosts regular meetups, workshops, and hands-on sessions
that focus on real-world security issues, vulnerabilities, and
attack-defense techniques. It serves as a collaborative space for
members to learn, exchange ideas, and improve their cybersecurity
skills, while fostering a culture of responsible security practices

### Our Goals

#### Promoting Equality

We strive to unite individuals from research, academia, and industry to
inspire and empower others to pursue careers in cybersecurity. Through
awareness and outreach, we aim to foster greater diversity and
inclusivity within the field.

#### Advancing Education

Our mission is to nurture the next wave of cybersecurity professionals.
We plan to offer mentorship programs for beginners and host talks by
industry experts to highlight the many opportunities and paths available
in cybersecurity.

#### Strengthening Community

Our goal is to connect individuals with a shared passion for
cybersecurity. Whether you're just starting out or have years of
experience, we aim to create a welcoming space for open discussions on
cybersecurity topics, career opportunities, and more. By facilitating
networking events, we hope to encourage active community participation
and meaningful connections.
