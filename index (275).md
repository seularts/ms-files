## Welcome

Welcome to OWASP San Antonio Chapter, a regional city chapter within
OWASP. Our Chapter serves San Antonio region as a platform to discuss
and share topics all around information and application security.

Anyone with an interested and enthusiastic about application security is
welcome. All meetings are free and open. You do not have to be an OWASP
member.

Referrals to this website or to individual meetings to colleagues or
acquaintances are welcome.

## What's going to happen?

To be announced via our [OWASP San Antonio Chapter Meetup
Group](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-sanantonio/). We usually have a
talks that related to information and application security.

## Further Notes

Please join our [OWASP San Antonio Chapter Meetup
Group](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-sanantonio/) for timely updates on
our OWASP Chapter San Antonio Meetup.

> > 1. Leveraging AI for Vulnerability Identification-NowSecure\
> > \
> > Artificial intelligence (AI) language models are emerging as
> > valuable tools for mobile security analysts and developers, offering
> > significant benefits such as aiding in structured vulnerability
> > assessments or generating code. However, limitations such as
> > "hallucinations" in which the model generates inaccurate or
> > misleading outputs highlight the importance of human oversight in
> > managing risk posed by AI. This talk covers a novel approach for
> > recovering application source code, leveraging AI language models to
> > transform pseudo-disassembly into high-level source code. This
> > method is able to handle complex abstractions introduced in
> > high-level languages SwiftUI or Dart and generates output in popular
> > programming languages like Swift, C#, Kotlin, Java, Python or even
> > Bash\
> > \
> > II. AI coding agents -Risks and Benefits-Endor Lab\
> > \
> > The proliferation of AI coding agents will accelerate the production
> > of code, but what are the risks associated with this acceleration?
> > In many ways the core challenge to securing these outputs will be
> > the familiar fundamental challenges that appsec has always faced:
> > maintaining an understanding of your inventory and risk-posture,
> > conducting security assessments at scale, and managing processes for
> > risk acceptance and remediation. Good appsec fundamentals will be
> > critical in the new era of AI generated code. But coding agents also
> > introduce novel concerns born from the inherent differences between
> > these agents and human developers, as well the additional layers of
> > abstraction which will become intrinsic to AI development:
> > understanding how to vet and validate non-human agents, identifying
> > the operational risks posed by agents trained on open-source, and
> > the complexity of managing code developed through natural language
> > will all require the development of new practices in appsec. This
> > talk will look at some of the new risks that will arise in the era
> > of large scale AI code development, and discuss possible paths
> > forward for deploying such agents in a secure way.\
> > \
> > III. AppSec for AI AND NHI -GrayLog\
> > \
> > APPSEC FOR AI AND NHI - As we\'re empowering NHIs (Non Human
> > Identity) to take on greater responsibilities, it\'s smart to wonder
> > how we\'ll keep these good bots in bounds. This isn\'t possible to
> > answer without acknowledging a dirty little secret \-- while modern
> > software is already driven by bots, modern security tools fall short
> > in observing and regulating interactions between bots and APIs,
> > whether those bots are trusted NHIs or malicious attackers. This
> > session dispels a few myths about bots and bot detection and shows a
> > few practical considerations and techniques to identify and block
> > high-risk activities.t
> >
> > > \
> > > \
> > > IV. The Shadow AI and AppSec: What You Don't Know Will Get
> > > You!-ByteWhisper\
> > > \
> > > The over-the-top headlines about artificial intelligence (AI) have
> > > only been outstripped by the breakneck speed by which many are
> > > adopting AI to transform their organizations. Shadow AI creates
> > > significant security exposures, like development teams processing
> > > sensitive customer data through unauthorized AI tools for creating
> > > mission-critical solutions using unvetted open-source AI models.
> > > This session will focus on where Shadow AI and appsec intersect --
> > > the coding co-pilots, the platforms, and the risks that they
> > > represent to your organization. This session will provide an
> > > overview of Shadow AI, how application development might
> > > unknowingly create Shadow AI, and tools to identify and mitigate
> > > Shadow AI.\
