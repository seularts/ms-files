I'm excited to announce that [OWASP's restated Articles and Certificate
of
Incorporation](../../../../www-policy/legal/OWASP-Foundation-Restated-Certificate-of-Incorporation-2024.pdf)
and new [Bylaws](../../../../www-policy/legal/bylaws.html) have been
approved by the Delaware Secretary of State. These documents are the
foundation of our governance and provide the framework for how the
Foundation operates. The new bylaws are the result of a comprehensive
review and update process that began in 2021. The changes are designed
to modernize and streamline the governance of the Foundation, and to
ensure that we are operating in the best interests of our members and
the broader community.

OWASP has had a very potted bylaws history. Our original 2004 Articles
and Certificate of Incorporation did not grant the Board of Directors
the power to amend or replace the bylaws. It also didn't have any
membership classes, and didn't really allow for a change to the
qualifications of Directors, such as being elected. This meant that
members from the establishment of a membership program to now were not
legally OWASP members, despite being treated as such. This also meant
that the replacement 2011 bylaws were never legally valid. The 2011
bylaws were amended extensively by various Boards in good faith that
they had the power to do so, but these amendments which were also never
legally valid. The 2011 bylaws are now replaced by the 2024 bylaws,
which are legally valid. The current Directors and Board composition and
qualifications, Members, and the Foundation are all now legally valid.

From around 2006 to 2012, OWASP was not officially an active business
according to Delaware. This was news to me, and there doesn't seem to be
a lot of information around this, but it came to light when working on
getting a Certificate of Good Standing. Luckily, Delaware did agree to
[revive OWASP in
2012](../../../../assets/legal/OWASP-Certificate-of-Revival-2012.pdf),
and now we're back in good standing. The things you learn!

In short, we had a huge legal mess, and it took a long time to clean it
all up. The process involved documenting all the changes to Boards since
2004, and ensuring that all the changes were legally valid by getting a
restated Certificate of Incorporation and completely new bylaws that are
compliant with the Delaware General Corporation Laws. This was a huge
effort, and I want to thank this and all previous Boards for getting
this done. I also want to thank our legal advisors at Gesmer who helped
us navigate the process and ensure that we are now in compliance with
the law.

The new bylaws are effectively a standard Delaware non-profit, member
non-stock corporation's bylaws, which should require minimal amendments,
because all the policy settings must now go to policies.

The new bylaws include a number of important changes, including:

- Compliant with the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) changes
  post 2017, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requirements for
  501(c)(3) organizations.
- Grants the Board the power to amend the bylaws for the first time in
  our history.
- Ensures that all previous Board votes amending the bylaws and member
  and director qualifications are valid.
- Establishes and confirms the composition of all previous Boards.
- Ensures that members are legally in our bylaws for the first time, and
  their rights and privileges.
- Updated definitions and clarifications to ensure that the bylaws are
  clear and easy to understand.
- Allows for remote Board meetings, despite this being how we operated
  for our entire history.
- Removes a lot of policy and procedure from the bylaws ... more on that
  in a bit.
- Clarifies a lot of our foundational principles, including the role of
  the Global Board, the Executive Director, and the staff.
- Clarifies that Complimentary members do not have a vote, which is
  consistent with legal advice for a membership non-stock corporation.
- Fairer process for suspensions and terminations of membership.
- The new bylaws also include anti-trust provisions.
- Makes the Executive Director an ex-officio member of the Board, with
  no vote, but with the ability to attend all meetings and participate
  in discussions.
- Grants the Board the power to dissolve OWASP if it is necessary to do
  so.
- Many other changes!

The next steps are to update our policies and procedures to align with
the new bylaws. This will take some time, but we are committed to
ensuring that the Foundation is operating in a transparent and
accountable manner. In particular, we need to work out how best to
ensure that Director qualifications are consistent with our past
practice, and to ensure that everyone who has a vote in the Foundation
is a member in good standing.

We can finally move forward with long overdue policy reviews, probably
starting with the expenses and travel policies, as well as revising the
Chapters and Projects policy.
