**Welcome to Consigliere, your SAST fixing advisor!**

### Project Goal

Standardization of the available fixing techniques of code issues
detected by the industry-leading SAST tools.

### Project Description

There are usually many ways to fix security vulnerabilities to eliminate
risk. However, when it comes to Static Code Analysis, different SAST
tools expect different mitigation techniques. As a result, developers do
not have a clear path to fixing a finding in a way that assures the SAST
tool will not recognize the issue anymore.

This document is aimed to standardize the valid techniques available for
fixing common SAST findings. It has two main consumers:

1.  Developers and security teams - will be able to fix SAST findings
    easily and with a clear path to ensure the issue isn't re-detected
    after the fix.
2.  SAST tools - will be able to support the different valid fix
    techniques available for the findings they produce, and by that
    eliminate mass amounts of false positive issues they report to their
    customers.

### Project Roadmap

1.  Create a document with guidelines and code samples of vulnerable
    codes and valid techniques to fix, for common findings - SQLi, XSS,
    Path Traversal, CMDi, SSRF, XXE, and more.
2.  Invite developers and security enthusiasts to add their feedback and
    contribute more issue types and/or mitigation techniques.
3.  Collaborate with the industry SAST leaders to promote the idea of a
    clear path for fixing SAST findings, so everyone can benefit and
    save precious time.

### Additional Comments

This is an open-source, free project, that's aimed to help anyone who
writes or maintains code. This project will be executed in full
collaboration with any actor in the industry that manages vulnerability
detection or auto-remediation, who is interested in participating.
