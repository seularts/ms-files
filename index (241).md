**Date:**

- **Friday, May 16, 2025**

**Description:** Crowdsourced Security in Practice: Lessons from the
Frontlines

As threats evolve faster than ever, traditional security models struggle
to keep pace. Enter crowdsourced security---a model that taps into the
global hacker community to uncover vulnerabilities before adversaries
do. In this session, we'll explore how Bugcrowd is helping
organizations---from startups to the federal government---scale their
security programs through managed bug bounty, vulnerability disclosure,
and penetration testing. We'll walk through real-world lessons learned,
common pitfalls, and how aligning with frameworks like OWASP Top 10
enhances outcomes. Whether you're an AppSec professional, pentester, or
just curious about the power of ethical hacking at scale, this session
will provide insights you can take back to your own environment.

**Agenda:**

- 11:15am - Registration and Lunch
- 12:15pm - Speaker - Jason Mueller - Crowdsourced Security in Practice:
  Lessons from the Frontlines
- 1:15pm - Depart

## Speakers

**Jason Mueller** is a cybersecurity professional and former U.S. Navy
cryptologist with over 20yrs of hands-on experience in cyber operations.
Having worked across government, defense, and commercial sectors, Jason
brings a unique perspective on the evolving threat landscape and how
organizations can stay ahead of it. At Bugcrowd, he helps security teams
harness the power of crowdsourced security to identify and remediate
risk at scale. With a background rooted in operational security and a
deep appreciation for the hacker mindset, Jason is passionate about
helping organizations adopt modern, proactive approaches to
cybersecurity that are both practical and impactful.
