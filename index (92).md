The OWASP OT Top Ten project aims to tackle the security risks emerging
from the combined efforts to easily interconnect operational technology
(OT) systems with our more familiar information technology (IT)
environments. Many of us are familiar with IT systems, the application
software, and networking infrastructure that we use daily. OT systems,
however, consist of specialized hardware and software that controls and
monitors everything from manufacturing processes to the electrical
network and generators that power our daily lives, to medical equipment
and industrial robots, as well as the process control systems in
critical infrastructure that allow us to safely drink water, treat our
waste and power our communities. These processes must continue to run
uninterrupted for us to survive and thrive, making OT systems invaluable
for operational efficiency. Organizations that rely on OT systems are
rightfully worried as they become increasingly vulnerable to cyber
threats associated with disruption, theft of sensitive data, physical
damage to processes, and even loss of life.

The deliverables will be a curated OT Top Ten security risks, growing
out of a community-driven list of critical security risks in OT
environments. Much like the widely used OWASP (Open Web Application
Security Project) API, Web and LLM (Low-Level Machine) Top Ten lists are
bolstered by detailed risk profiles and actionable advice. Organizations
and security professionals will have a better understanding and
practical advice to secure their OT systems.

### Road Map

Phase 1: Initial Research and Community Involvement Conduct a broad
survey of OT security professionals and industry leaders to gather
insights on the most prevalent OT security risks. Host community calls
or workshops to discuss potential risks and collect feedback from the
OWASP community.

Phase 2: Risk Identification and Categorization Develop a preliminary
list of risks based on the research and feedback collected. Refine the
risk categories, ensuring each is clearly defined, relevant to OT
environments, and supported by real-world incidents or vulnerabilities.
Begin drafting detailed risk profiles, including descriptions, examples,
and mitigation strategies.

Phase 3: Public Review and Iteration Publish the initial draft of the OT
Top Ten list and open it for public comment and community feedback.
Incorporate feedback to refine the list and improve the accuracy and
relevance of the risks identified. Collaborate with OT security experts
and OWASP contributors to ensure thorough vetting of the risks.

Phase 4: Finalization and Publication Finalize the OT Top Ten list, risk
profiles, and all supporting documentation. Publish the official OWASP
OT Top Ten report. Promote the release across the community and hold
webinars or presentations to introduce the list to relevant
stakeholders.

Phase 5: Ongoing Updates and Maintenance (Ongoing) Continuously monitor
developments in OT security and update the OT Top Ten list as new risks
or trends emerge.
