Go Language - Web Application Secure Coding Practices is a guide written
for anyone who is using the Go Programming Language and aims to use it
for web development.

The main goal of this book is to help developers avoid common mistakes
while at the same time, learning a new programming language through a
"hands-on approach".

## Description

According to Stack Overflow's annual Developer Survey, Go has made the
top 5 most Loved and Wanted programming languages list for the second
year in a row. With its surge in popularity, it is critical that
applications developed in Go are designed with security in mind.

The primary audience of the Go Secure Coding Practices Guide is
developers, particularly the ones with previous experience with other
programming languages.

The book is also a great reference to those learning programming for the
first time, who have already finish the [Go
tour](https://tour.golang.org/list).

This book covers the [OWASP Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference
Guide](../www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/index.html)
topic-by-topic, providing examples and recommendations using Go, to help
developers avoid common mistakes and pitfalls.

After reading this book, you'll be more confident you're developing
secure Go applications.
