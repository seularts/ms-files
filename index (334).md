## Welcome

Welcome to the OWASP chapter local to the Minneapolis / St. Paul area of
Minnesota.

- Meeting locations vary. Please reference our [Meetup
  page](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-MSP-Meetup) for announcements.
- Everyone is welcome to join us at our chapter meetings; security
  professionals, software developers, project managers, everyone!

## Participation

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit
foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our
projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to
anyone interested in improving application security.

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapter
Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/). Financial contributions should
only be made online using the authorized online donation button. To be a
**speaker** at OWASP-MSP or **any** other OWASP Chapter in the world,
review the [speaker
agreement](https://owasp.org/www-policy/legal/speaker-agreement), fill
in the [speaker information
doc](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-minneapolis-st-paul/download/OWASP-MSP_speaker_information.dotx),
and send it to the local chapter leaders (see the right panel of this
page) with details of the OWASP Project, independent research, or
related application security topic you would like to present.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in OWASP
[Projects](https://owasp.org/projects),
[Chapters](https://owasp.org/chapters),
[Events](https://owasp.org/events), [Online
Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com), and [Community Slack
Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/). We especially encourage diversity in
all our initiatives. OWASP is a fantastic place to learn about
application security, to network, and even to build your reputation as
an expert. We also encourage you to [become a
member](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/membership) or consider
a [donation](https://owasp.org/donate) to support our ongoing work.
