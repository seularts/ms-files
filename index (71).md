At the SAMM Core Team Summit, 22-25 March, the team decided that
maintenance and further development of the SAMMwise SAMM assessment tool
would not be supported within the scope of the SAMM Project.

This project is intended to facilitate maintenance and enhancements of
the SAMMwise tool, independently of the SAMM model against which
assessments are performed.

The original SAMMwise tool was donated to OWASP by Datacom (NZ) in 2022,
with its codebase added to the owaspsamm GitHub repository. It's a
JavaScript single-page web application, intended to execute in the
user's browser.

### Road Map

The SAMMwise tool donated to OWASP in 2022 was a minimum viable product
(MVP) release, developed by a small team at Datacom (NZ) over a few
weeks.

The first phase of the project will entail updating the MVP application,
to produce a reliable Version 1.0 application with the same
functionality, but will existing known issues (functional bugs and
security findings) resolved.

The second phase will focus on enhancing the application, to support
viewing assessment trends across several points in time (roadmap
milestones), and implementing Benchmark submission functionality.

The third phase will entail creating an 'enterprise' dashboard, allowing
an organisation's users to browse the full set of stored assessments,
filter and sort them by various criteria (name, date, overall "SAMM
Score," status, etc.), and creating basic visualizations combining
results from two or more assessments.
