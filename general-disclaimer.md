## OWASP Makes No Guarantee of Validity

OWASP is an online open-content collaborative project, that is, a
voluntary association of individuals and groups who are developing a
common resource of human knowledge. The structure of the project allows
anyone with an Internet connection and World Wide Web browser to alter
its content. Please be advised that nothing found here has necessarily
been reviewed by professionals with the expertise required to provide
you with complete, accurate or reliable information.

That is not to say that you will not find valuable and accurate
information in OWASP; much of the time you will. However, OWASP cannot
guarantee the validity of the information found here. The content of any
given article may recently have been changed, vandalized or altered by
someone whose opinion does not correspond with the state of knowledge in
the relevant fields.

## No formal peer review

We are working on ways to select and highlight reliable versions of
articles. Our active community of editors uses tools to monitor new and
changing content. However, OWASP is not uniformly peer reviewed; while
readers may correct errors or engage in casual peer review, they have no
legal duty to do so and thus all information read here is without any
implied warranty of fitness for any purpose or use whatsoever. Even
articles that have been vetted by informal peer review or featured
article processes may later have been edited inappropriately, just
before you view them.

## No contract; limited license

Please make sure that you understand that the information provided here
is being provided freely, and that no kind of agreement or contract is
created between you and the owners or users of this site, the owners of
the servers upon which it is housed, the individual OWASP contributors,
any project administrators, sysops or anyone else who is in "any way
connected" with this project or sister projects subject to your claims
against them directly. You are being granted a limited license to copy
anything from this site; it does not create or imply any contractual or
extracontractual liability on the part of OWASP or any of its agents,
members, organizers or other users.

## Trademarks

Any of the trademarks, service marks, collective marks, design rights,

laws of the country or jurisdiction from where you are viewing this
information. OWASP content is stored on servers around the world. Laws
in your country or jurisdiction may not protect or allow the same kinds
of speech or distribution. OWASP does not encourage the violation of any
