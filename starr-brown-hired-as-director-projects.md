Colorado Springs, CO, April 22, 2024 -- OWASP is thrilled to announce
the addition of Starr Brown to the OWASP Foundation team. As the newly
appointed Director of Projects, Starr brings a wealth of expertise and a
fresh perspective to our community.

Starr Brown joins us with an impressive track record in our industry,
being the Executive Director of XR Village, a Principal Consultant of a
penetration testing firm who ran CTFs and education programs, an ex-CIO
and ex-COO with deep project management, contracts, grants, IT
innovation, and risk management experience.

Starr, an OWASP Member, comes to us with solid grants and project
management experience, which is precisely what the OWASP community needs
to take projects to the next level and grow.

Starr's appointment reflects our commitment to excellence and strategic
development. As we continue to expand our Projects portfolio in a
strategic fashion, Starr's leadership will play a pivotal role in
shaping our future endeavors.

"I am very excited for our Projects Community that we have found such a
strong candidate for Director of Projects as Starr. She will be
communicating with all our project leaders, particularly our Flagship
and Production level projects, within the first 90 days and coming up
with a proactive and strategic Projects plan." Says Andrew van der
Stock, Executive Director of the OWASP Foundation.
