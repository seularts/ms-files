# Hi! ðŸ‘‹ {#hi-}

Welcome to Netryx *(pronounced 'netriks')*, advanced java security
framework lead by [exploit.org](https://exploit.org/) group. It was
created to help developers make their web applications more secure and
effective against various threats.

### Netryx Modules

It is **modular** security framework that is designed to integrate to as
many applications, as possible:

### Armor

Armor is a backbone module of Netryx.

#### Brief overview:

- ReDoS Protected Input Validators based on rules
- Secure Memory Allocation for sensitive data storage and obfuscation
- JS, HTML, LDAP and CMD Encoders to protect from various injection
  attacks
- Centralized security event scope

#### Additional features:

- TLS Packet Parsing Engine - Base for TLS packet inspection
- Akamai HTTP/2, JA3, JA4, JA4H Fingerprinting Base - Fingerprint
  generation utilities

### Pipeline

**Secure By Default**

Reactive security pipeline based for Netty based servers, that uses
Armor as a backbone.

#### Brief overview:

- HTTP/2 0day RST Flood Protection
- HTTP Flood Protection
- IP Whitelisting/Blacklisting
- Security Policy Management
- Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- JA3, JA4, JA4H, HTTP/2 Fingerprinting

### WAF

**Secure By Default**

Advanced Web Application Firewall for Netty based servers, that uses
Armor Pipeline's backend.

#### Brief overview:

- Passive Injection protection (SQL, XSS, LDAP, CMD, etc)
- Passive Path Traversal protection
- Malicious client detection using JA3, JA4, JA4H, and HTTP/2
  fingeprints
- Flexible Rule Management System

### Machine Learning Core

Lightweight Machine Learning library for learning and running models in
an intensive environment. Utilized in Netryx WAF for mitigating threats.

Implements following algorithms:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **kNN**
- **Kernel SVM**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**

### Memory

Netryx Memory manages sensitive data securely in memory using Java
native interface for UNIX systems.

#### Brief overview:

- Unswappable memory allocation
- Memory obfuscation
- Memory regions with protection from unauthorized READ/WRITE/EXEC

### Events

Zero dependency event manager designed for building even-based
applications. Used by Netryx WAF for Security Events management.

### Road Map

Now - End of Year 1 Q1: Improve documentation and create training
materials for developers on the main features of Netryx. Q2: Adaptation
of User-Side and Pipeline-Side functionality to meet user requirements
and potentially new threats. Q3-Q4: Extending Netryx support for
additional Java frameworks, collecting feedback for further
improvements.

Year 2 Q1: Designing AI driven WAF system following privacy and security
requirements of processed data. Define possibilities of turning it into
decentralized (p2p) view. Q2-Q3: Development and testing of WAF system,
collecting feedback from relevant stakeholders Q4: First autonomous WAF
system release

Year 3 Q1-Q2: Exploration of how Netryx can be adapted for other
programming languages, such as Python, C#, JavaScript and Rust. Q3-Q4:
Develop Netryx prototypes for selected languages, begin testing with
community participation.

Year 4 Q1-Q2: Launching versions of Netryx for new programming
languages, organizing events to train developers. Q3-Q4: Develop
partnerships with academic and research organizations, strengthening
interaction with the community to jointly develop new features and
improvements.

Basic assumptions and conditions:

- Active community participation and openness to innovation are key to
  the success of the project.
- Staying alert to changes in cybersecurity and adapting to new threats.
- Collaboration with leading experts and organizations to ensure high
  quality and relevance of the solutions offered.
