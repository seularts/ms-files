## Using Fuzzing in Cybersecurity

Library](index.html#div-centlibrary){onclick="location.hash='div-centlibrary'; location.reload();"},

Fuzzing is a technique to test programs with generated data. Its main
goal is to detect crashes and non-expected failures. Radamsa is a
general-purpose, black-box-oriented mutating fuzzer. In this talk, José
will show examples of fuzzing using radamsa from basic command line
tools to network services. We will also discuss some applications in
cybersecurity of fuzzing involving automation of test cases.

### Agenda:

- 4:30 Say Howdy
- 5:00: Using Fuzzing in Cybersecurity
- Upcoming events:
  - Around August 1: [Albuquerque Software Social

## Cross-Site Request Forgery Basics

Tuesday, April 30, 2024, at 5:30 pm

[Cesar Chavez Community
Center](https://www.google.com/maps?ll=35.065797,-106.564822&z=16&t=m&hl=en-US&gl=US&mapclient=embed&cid=1931813735759550125){target="_blank"},
Meeting Room

Franklin and Althea will discuss [the basics of Cross-Site Request
Forgery (CSRF)](assets/pdf/csrf-handout.pdf){target="_blank"}, assuming
as little knowledge of web development as possible. This will include a
review of how web browsers load and render web pages by making HTTP
requests to a web server, how cookies are used to authenticate requests,
and how authenticated requests are spoofed in a CSRF attack. They will
also discuss browser security mechanisms that facilitate CSRF
prevention, and what a website designer can do to prevent these attacks.
The talk will be followed by a lab exercise from Portswigger.

Please RSVP to
[\[email protected\]](../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html){.__cf_email__
cfemail="88eefae9e6e3e4e1e6a6ecf1edfac8e7ffe9fbf8a6e7faef"}. If you want
to participate in the lab exercise, please bring a personal computer and
make an account on the Portswigger website before the event. It is also
recommended (but not required) to install either Burp Suite Community
Edition, or another web proxy of your choice.

### Agenda:

- Meet and greet
- Featured presentation "Cross-Site Request Forgery Basics"
- Elect 2 co-leaders for next year
- Pitch ideas and recruit volunteers for future presentations

Participants will be invited to eyeball code in the context of their
favorite risk from OWASP Top 10; list issues; discuss remediation
strategies; and prioritize remediations.

All activities can be completed by looking at code. But you can also
test on your machine with Docker: deploy
https://github.com/pzzd/docker-lamp and send a request to
[\[email protected\]](../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html){.__cf_email__
cfemail="1a6875697f347e637f685a756d7b696a3475687d"} for access to the
web application repo.

## Basics of SQL injection

Monday, November 27, 2023, at 4 pm

UNM Centennial Library, DEN2

UNM student Franklin Pezzuti Dyer will discuss the basics of how
databases might be used for web applications, how a web app can
manipulate a database using SQL, and how this can leave an app open for
attack if SQL commands are handled unsafely. The meeting will consist of
a short introductory talk, followed by a lab session consisting of SQL
injection exercises on deliberately vulnerable websites hosted by
Portswigger.

If you would like to participate in the lab session, please come
prepared with a Portswigger account, and a proxy of your choice
installed. You will need this to capture, examine and modify HTTP
packets. You could use Burp Suite (software by Portswigger, recommended)
or an open-source alternative like mitmproxy.

Our space is limited to 16 people, so please RSVP to
[\[email protected\]](../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html){.__cf_email__
cfemail="b0d6c0d5cacac5c4d9d4c9d5c2f0c5dedd9ed5d4c5"}.

access to a website.
