## Welcome

The OWASP® Somerset chapter seeks to bring an insightful approach to
application security to Kentucky and the surrounding area. Through
speakers, CTFs, mixers, and other events we hope to grow a thriving
security community in the area.

## Call for Speakers

If you are interested in speaking at one of our meeting reach out to
[Doyle](https://owasp.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9efaf1e7f2fbb0eaebecf0fbecdef1e9ffedeeb0f1ecf9)
or
[Misty](https://owasp.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c1aca8b2b5efb5b4b3afa4b381aeb6a0b2b1efaeb3a6)
to coordinate. We believe that everyone has something to contribute. If
you have a topic of interest, but aren't sure about presenting reach
out! We will do our best to help you pull together a presentation - or
pair you with someone willing to present materials you develop together.

## Participation

foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our
projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to
