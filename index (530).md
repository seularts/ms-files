Ever wanted to network and learn along with other AppSec professionals?
We host nearly a dozen events each year varying in format to week long
trainings and conferences, to single day programs. OWASP events are a
great way to:

- Improve your career skills
- Build your professional network
- Learn about new trends in the industry

While some of our events have corporate sponsors, the content is vendor
neutral, and speakers are carefully selected ensuring a good return on
your investment of time and money. Often times are larger events also
host Expositions, Capture the Flags, and Career Fairs. Often members get
a discount on conference passes.
