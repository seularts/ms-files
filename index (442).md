### [John Mocuta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atucom/) - August 29, 2024

### Finding a 0-Day & Getting a CVE {#finding-a-0-day--getting-a-cve}

#### Summary

##### Context

:::: {.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}
::: highlight
``` highlight
John, a red-team specialist in network, web app, and hardware security, discovered a 0-day vulnerability in a client's 
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) code, which had never been reviewed. John was also disappointed that RPAs had nothing
to do with actual robots.
```
:::
::::

##### Process

Submit a form at [cve.mitre.org](https://cve.mitre.org/) with product
and version details. John's Submission:
[CVE-2022-29856](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2022-29856)

##### Key Concepts

Options for Disclosure:

- No disclosure
  - Keep the vulnerability private--i.e. not discloused to anyone.
- Full disclosure (public)
  - Release (possibly immediately) the details of the vulnerability to
    the public, without notifying the vendor first.
- Coordinated/Responsible disclosure (report to vendor first)
  - Report the vulnerability to the vendor first, allowing them time to
    fix it before publicly disclosing it.

Safe Harbor

- Protection from legal repercussions when reporting vulnerabilities.

Reporting Hierarchy:

1.  PR
2.  Legal
3.  InfoSec

Austin Harbor Association

- Allows anonymous reporting of vulnerabilities.
