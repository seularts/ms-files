## Our Mission

### "Define the industry standard for mobile application security." {#define-the-industry-standard-for-mobile-application-security}

The OWASP Mobile Application Security (MAS) flagship project provides a
security standard for mobile apps (OWASP MASVS) and a comprehensive
testing guide (OWASP MASTG) that covers the processes, techniques, and
tools used during a mobile app security test, as well as an exhaustive
set of test cases that enables testers to deliver consistent and
complete results.

All the information about OWASP MAS can be found in the [official
website](https://mas.owasp.org/). There you can also read both the MASVS
and the MASTG.

### OWASP MASVS

The OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) is
the industry standard for mobile app security. It can be used by mobile
software architects and developers seeking to develop secure mobile
applications, as well as security testers to ensure completeness and
consistency of test results.

*Previously known as OWASP MSTG (Mobile Security Testing Guide)*

The OWASP Mobile Application Security Testing Guide (MASTG) is a
comprehensive manual for mobile application security testing. A
fundamental learning resource for both beginners and professionals
covering a variety of topics from mobile OS internals to advanced
reverse engineering techniques.

It also provides an exhaustive set of test cases to be used for
verifying the controls listed in the OWASP MASVS, including all relevant
guidance and detailed information about the technical processes,
techniques and tools.

style="padding: 10px;" width="350px"}

The Mobile Application Security Checklist can be used to apply the MASVS
controls during security assessments as it conveniently links to the
corresponding MASTG test cases.

## Donators

While both the MASVS and the MASTG are created and maintained by the
community on a voluntary basis, sometimes a little bit of outside help
is required. We therefore thank our donators for providing the funds to
support us on our project activities. The Donation Packages are
described on the [Donation page](https://mas.owasp.org/donate/).

**The OWASP Foundation is very grateful for the support by the
individuals and organizations listed. However please note, the OWASP
Foundation is strictly vendor neutral and does not endorse any of its
supporters. Donations do not influence the content of the MASVS or MASTG
in any way.**
