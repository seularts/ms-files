#### TALK ABSTRACT

\
**"Using OWASP Nettacker for Recon and Vulnerability Scanning" by [Sam
Stepanyan](https://twitter.com/securestep9)**\
The OWASP Nettacker project was created to automate information
gathering, vulnerability scanning, and in general to aid the penetration
testing engagements. Nettacker is able to run various scans using a
variety of methods and generate scan reports for applications and
networks, including services, bugs, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations,
default credentials and many other cool features - for example the
ability to chain different scan methods. This relatively new (Summer
2017) and a lesser-known OWASP project has generated a huge amount of
interest at BlackHat Europe 2018/2019 Arsenal live demo gathering
massive crowds of seasoned hackers and penetration testers eager to see
this new tool in action. This talk will showcase the OWASP Nettacker
project giving an overview of its features and including a live demo of
the tool. Overview by Sam - <https://youtu.be/Y4ANGdG8NvU>, project -
