- Introduction The OWASP ASM (Attack Surface Management) Top 10 is a
  community-driven project that identifies the most critical risks
  associated with external attack surfaces. While OWASP has historically
  focused on web application security (OWASP Web Top 10) and API
  security (OWASP API Security Top 10), modern apps extend beyond
  traditional infrastrucures and boundaries, third-party SaaS
  applications, exposed APIs, and forgotten assets.

With organizations increasingly shifting to cloud-native architectures
and expanding their digital footprint, security teams struggle to track,
assess, and mitigate risks associated with externally exposed assets.
The OWASP ASM Top 10 aims to bridge this gap by providing a structured
risk framework for external attack surface exposures.

- How ASM Relates to Web Security & Traditional OWASP Projects OWASP's
  foundational projects, like OWASP Web Security Top 10 and API Security
  Top 10, focus primarily on securing known and controlled application
  environments. However, organizations today operate in a world where:

- Web applications and APIs are interconnected with third-party
  services, cloud environments, and SaaS tools.

- Security perimeters have become more complex, with assets dynamically
  appearing and disappearing.

- Threat actors actively perform reconnaissance on external attack
  surfaces before launching targeted attacks.

ASM and Web Security: The Missing Link

- The OWASP Web Security Top 10 primarily focuses on vulnerabilities
  within applications (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, Broken Access Control).
- The OWASP API Security Top 10 tackles risks related to API
  authentication, authorization, and data exposure.
- However, neither project addresses the broader risk of asset
  discovery, external exposure, or attack surface visibility; which is
  where ASM becomes critical.

For example, an organization may secure its main web application, but if
it has forgotten subdomains running outdated software or exposed
misconfigured APIs, attackers can exploit these weaknesses. The OWASP
ASM Top 10 will help organizations understand and mitigate these risks
before they become an entry point for attackers.

- Why This Project is Critical for Modern Security Security teams
  increasingly adopt Attack Surface Management (ASM) platforms to gain
  visibility into external-facing risks, but there is no standardized
  framework for prioritizing these risks. The OWASP ASM Top 10 will
  serve as a benchmark for assessing, categorizing, and mitigating
  external attack surface threats, ensuring alignment with modern
  security strategies.

Key Benefits:

- Enhances OWASP's Web Security Efforts by providing a risk-based
  approach to external exposure.
- Aligns with ASM Industry Trends, ensuring organizations can
  systematically identify and address external risks.
- Provides a Standardized Framework for security teams, vendors, and
  regulators to prioritize attack surface risks.

This project aims to empower security teams with actionable insights,
risk categorization, and remediation strategies to improve external risk
visibility and attack surface hygiene.

- ASM Top 10: The OWASP ASM Top 10 categorizes the most impactful
  external attack surface risks, including:

- Unmanaged & Unknown External Assets

- Shadow IT, forgotten subdomains, untracked cloud resources, and legacy
  applications expanding the attack surface.

- Exposed APIs & Unprotected Endpoints

- Publicly accessible APIs, missing authentication, excessive
  permissions, and API abuse vectors.

- Public Code & Credential Exposure

- Leaked API keys, hardcoded secrets in mobile apps, public GitHub
  repositories, and exposed configuration files.

- Fake Domains & Impersonation Attacks

- Typosquatting, phishing domains, fake mobile apps, and brand
  impersonation threats.

- Third-Party SaaS & Shadow IT Risks

- Untracked SaaS applications, exposed Postman collections, and
  unauthorized cloud services storing sensitive data.

- Cloud & SaaS Misconfigurations

- Publicly exposed cloud storage, misconfigured IAM permissions,
  unsecured file-sharing links, and weak authentication in SaaS
  applications.

- Exposed Debug & Test Environments

- Publicly accessible staging environments, development servers, and
  leftover testing infrastructure.

- Insecure DNS Configurations & Domain Hijacking

- Dangling DNS records, misconfigured MX/NS records, and hijackable
  subdomains leading to takeovers.

- Unauthenticated Resources Accessible on the Internet

- Publicly exposed admin panels, storage buckets, CI/CD pipelines,
  monitoring dashboards, and logs.

- Lack of Continuous Attack Surface Monitoring

- Failure to detect newly exposed assets, missing automated inventory
  tracking, and weak external risk monitoring.

- How will this project benefit the security community?

- Security Practitioners: Provides a risk prioritization framework to
  reduce external exposure.

- Developers & DevOps Teams: Raises awareness of common
  misconfigurations in APIs, cloud environments, and CI/CD pipelines.

- CISOs & Security Leaders: Helps define external risk reduction
  strategies and align with security best practices.

- Researchers & Penetration Testers: Offers insights into real-world
  attack vectors used for reconnaissance and initial compromise.

### Road Map

Phase 1 (0-3 months): Project Initiation:

- Draft initial OWASP ASM Top 10 list
- Gather contributors and community feedback
- Define criteria for risk classification

Phase 2 (3-6 months): Research & Documentation:

- Collect real-world examples and case studies
- Define risk assessment methodology
- Draft best practices and mitigation techniques

Phase 3 (6-12 months): Public Release & Community Engagement:

- Publish v1.0 of OWASP ASM Top 10
- Gather feedback and iterate
- Present findings at security conferences, webinars, and OWASP events

Ongoing (After 12 months)

- Maintain and update the list based on evolving threats
- Collaborate with other OWASP projects (e.g., OWASP Amass, OWASP API
  Security Top 10)
- Publish periodic industry reports on ASM trends
