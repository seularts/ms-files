The purpose is to give both developers and testers a platform for
learning how to test applications and how to code securely. PyGoat is
written in python and used Django web framework as a platform. It has
both traditional web application vulnerabilities (i.e. XSS, SQLi) as
well.\
PyGoat also has an area where you can see the source code to determine
where the mistake was made that caused the vulnerability and allows you
to make changes to secure it.
