## Securing the Web for Everyone

OWASP is a radically transparent organization. At least 77% of all funds
in 2020 went directly to programs, despite a huge drop in our income. We
are committed to ensuring each every dollar we receive through
memberships, donations, gifts, and event sponsorships are spent
frugally, responsibly, and on our mission. We are currently reforming
our finances to ensure that no matter what our income is, more than 80%
of all funds are spent directly on program delivery to benefit our
mission, and not sunk into excessive marketing costs or general
administration overheads.

The OWASP Foundation is deeply committed to making apps more secure -
and our industry more inclusive. Pictured above is a recent Introduction
to AppSec Training Class at our Global AppSec Conference that was
offered at no charge to diversity candidates. The Women in AppSec,
Diversity and Inclusion Committee has championed this effort and is
making progress at increasing the diversity of the AppSec community. The
Women In AppSec, Diversity, and Inclusion Committee that has the same
organizational focus as projects, events, and chapters.

OWASP offers discounted Supporter dues for Corporate Supporters,
students, and people living in developing economies. We are committed to
ensuring the entire world has access to OWASP's materials, projects,
events, and chapters, no matter where you are located. And of course,
all of OWASP Projects, Chapters, Local Meetings, and many events are
free and open to all attendees.

## Tax Deductibility of Gifts & Non-Exempt Status {#tax-deductibility-of-gifts--non-exempt-status}

As a US-based 501(c)3 registered non-profit charity, donations to the
OWASP Foundation are generally tax deductible. OWASP membership fees,
OWASP conferences fees, and OWASP conference sponsorship include
benefits for the paying organization/individual which limits their
tax-deductibility. Please consult a tax professional or your local
taxing authority for details. The OWASP Foundation US Tax ID (EIN) is:

pre-approval from the OWASP Foundation prior to incurring the charge.
