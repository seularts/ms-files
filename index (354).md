## Welcome to the OWASP Lisboa chapter

Welcome to the new OWASP Lisboa chapter. This local chapter builds on
the experience of the previous OWASP chapter which was active between
2008 and 2018 (see [History](index.html#div-history)).

The goal of this chapter is to promote application security in Portugal,
engaging the local community through meetings, speaking events, and
project contributions.

# History

This page tells a bit of the **OWASP Lisboa** Chapter history. Actually,
this chapter builds on top of a former **OWASP Portugal** Chapter, that
existed between 2008 and 2018. During this period, the OWASP Portuguese
Chapter, helped disseminate the OWASP mission in Portugal, throughout
the organization and participation on multiple events, meetups and the
collaboration on some projects.

An older version and archived version of the chapter page can be [found
here](https://web.archive.org/web/20170324093023/https://owasp.org/index.php/Portugal).
