Monday, May 12, 2025

We're proud to share that **OWASP is once again an official mentoring
organization for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025**---and this year,
we've secured **15 contributor slots** across some of the most impactful
open-source security projects in the world.

This milestone reinforces OWASP's ongoing commitment to open-source
innovation and highlights the strength of our global community of
mentors and contributors, as well as our commitment to
*education-by-doing* with the GSoC program.

## ðŸ”§ GSoC 2025: What's on Deck? {#-gsoc-2025-whats-on-deck}

Contributors will get hands-on experience improving and expanding some
of OWASP's most vital tools:

- **[Juice Shop](../../../../www-project-juice-shop/index.html)** -- A
  globally-used, intentionally insecure web app for security training.
- **[Nettacker](../../../../www-project-automated-threats/index.html)**
  -- A fast, automated network scanner built for vulnerability
  detection.
- **[Offensive Web Testing Framework
  (OWTF)](../../../../www-project-owtf/index.html)** -- A smart
  framework for streamlined penetration testing.
- **[Bug Logging Tool (BLT)](../../../../www-project-blt/index.html)**
  -- A next-gen bug tracker focused on gamification to incentivize bug
  and security reporting.
- **[Nest](http://nest.owasp.org/)** -- Core infrastructure to power and
  enable the OWASP projects and contributors ecosystem.
- **[PyGoat](../../../../www-project-pygoat/index.html)** -- A
  Python-based sandbox for learning and exposing security flaws in
  modern stacks.
- **[OpenCRE](../../../../www-project-opencre/index.html)** -- A
  collaborative cybersecurity knowledge base & reference system.

## ðŸš€ What's Next? {#-whats-next}

Selected contributors will begin collaborating with mentors to level up
these tools and help push open-source security forward.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸ™Œ Thank You {#-thank-you}

Huge thanks to our project leads, mentors, contributors, and the OWASP
community who made this year's GSoC application a success. Let's make
this summer one to remember!
