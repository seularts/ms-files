The OWASP Pittsburgh meetings are FREE and OPEN to anyone interested in
learning more about application security. We encourage individuals to
provide knowledge transfer via hands-on training and presentations of
specific OWASP projects and research topics and sharing SDLC knowledge.
The chapter is committed to providing an engaging experience for a
variety of audience types ranging from local students and those
beginning in Application Security, to those experienced and accomplished
professionals who are looking for competent collaborators for
OWASP-related projects. To this end, we will continue to conduct monthly
chapter meetings application security topics.

Please review our schedule at
[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Pittsburgh-Chapter/) for upcoming
talks.
