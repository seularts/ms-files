## Welcome

Welcome to the OWASP Bursa Technical University Chapter. [Bursa
Technical University](https://www.btu.edu.tr/) is a state university

The educational gap in Information Security between colleges and
industry indicates that there is a remarkable gap. The awareness of
people should be improved to sustain a secure information-centric
environment. OWASP BTU took this responsiblity to reach and educate more
people with the help of OWASP. Join us to create a secure and trustable
tomorrow.
