### Tuesday November 21, 2023 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM

`Hosted By`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}: Onapsis
`Topic`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}: Cybersecurity of
Critical SAP Apps

Rising Tide Brewery - 103 Fox St - Portland, ME

#### Description

Application and software security are so vitally important in all
aspects of the business especially with every company becoming a
software company as they navigate through digital transformations.

With that being said ERP systems are some of **THE MOST** critical
applications within enterprises today and come with their own unique set
of security challenges.

The fine folks at Onapsis who 100% specialize in SAP and ERP application
security will be on site to dive deep into these specific challenges.
They will also review real world attacks on SAP ERP environments and
discuss the best in class strategies and measures you can do to mitigate
the risk of exploitation of your ERP environments.

Anyone who is involved in SAP ERP environments from both a software
development and security perspective would gain a tremendous amount of
knowledge attending this meetup.

`Topic`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}: Jump into Mobile AppSec
with the OWASP MAS Project

IDEXX Corporate Headquarters - 1 Idexx Dr - Westbrook, ME

#### Description

Mobile apps dominate all digital time spent online - but mobile AppSec
programs often lag. Jumpstart your team and skills by stepping inside
the OWASP Mobile AppSec Project (MAS), the OWASP Mobile Application
Security Verification Standard (MASVS), and OWASP Mobile Application
Security Testing Guide (MASTG) to learn about the fundamentals of mobile
app security and the latest updates just released in OWASP MASVS V2
launched at OWASP Global AppSec in Dublin. Learn the differences in
Mobile AppSec vs Web AppSec and how to put OWASP MAS project, tools and
resources to work.

In this session we will drill down into the top 5 most frequent security
issues found in testing thousands of mobile apps. Learn how to test for
them, and how to teach your dev teams to prevent them with code
examples, test examples, links to additional resources and how to build
your own toolkit. Along the way we will hit the latest privacy and
security updates with iOS and Android.

e-commerce web application and is meant to show how modern
JavaScript-based applications can be compromised.

In this follow-along workshop we will cover:
