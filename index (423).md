## Welcome

Welcome to the OWASP Firat University student chapter! We're thrilled to
welcome you to our community. Fırat University is a state university
located in Elazığ, Turkey. The establishment of the university dates
back to Elazığ Higher Technical School, which was founded in 1967. Our
university stands out with the qualified education it provides
especially in the field of engineering. In addition, the first and only
Forensic Informatics Engineering department in Turkey is also located in
our university. Our Forensic Engineering, Software Engineering and
Computer Engineering departments have made significant contributions to
the cyber security workforce in Turkey. Here at OWASP Firat University,
we're dedicated to fostering a dynamic environment for all things
related to Cyber Security. We host a variety of events and activities,
including Meetups, conferences, professional speaker series, workshops,
job shadowing opportunities, campus visits, alumni interviews, and
inspiring presentations. Join us in shaping the future of cybersecurity
education and innovation!
