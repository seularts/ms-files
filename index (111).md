## Description

According to the United States Department of Homeland Security, the root
cause of around 90% of security vulnerabilities are due to issues in
software design and weakness in coding practices. This shows the
critical need for secure coding, to minimise vulnerabilities within code
and to ensure software products developed are secure. This is where our
product, Mimosa, can help.

Mimosa is a holistic web application tool that seeks to test users on
their offensive and defensive skills relating to programming, to not
only educate users on secure coding but to also inculcate good
programming habits.How Mimosa works is that challenges from various
categories are provided to users in which they will be awarded points
upon completion. These challenges come from a wide range of categories,
from access control to cryptography, all requiring users to employ
different techniques to solve them. Users can also earn badges when they
complete challenges which motivate them to work harder to solve more
challenges. Mimosa gamifies the user experience and has an intuitive
interface. Challenges are also made to be fun with gamification elements
to make it more fun for learners. We will also be incorporating short
videos to teach some of the secure coding topics and upgrade Mimosa to
both a teaching and assessment tool. We will also be publishing
challenge creation vides soon.
