# Introduction

DevSecOps is an approach to software development that combines
development, security, and operations (hence the name) into a single,
continuous process. It aims to integrate security measures throughout
the entire software development lifecycle, from planning and design to
deployment and maintenance.

Traditionally, security has been an afterthought in the software
development process, with security experts brought in only after the
development was complete. This led to many security vulnerabilities and
breaches that could have been prevented if security had been considered
from the beginning. DevSecOps seeks to change this by incorporating
security into every step of the development process, making security a
priority from the outset.

The DevSecOps approach has gained popularity in recent years as the need
for secure software has become more important than ever. With the rise
of cyber threats, data breaches, and regulatory requirements,
organizations must prioritize security in their software development
practices. DevSecOps provides a way to achieve this by creating a
culture of security that permeates every aspect of the development
process.
