### Greetings Cybersecurity Enthusiasts!

OWASP St. Joseph's Group of Institutions was established in January
2024. We host webinars, workshops, and meetups. Anyone interested is
welcome to attend and learn from these free events.   We are glad to
welcome you to the official homepage. As an OWASP associate, we are
dedicated to building a strong community of cybersecurity experts and
enthusiasts.   Our goal is to support organizations and people in their
efforts to create, manage, and run a safe online awareness program.  
With the constantly changing realm of cyber dangers, our community acts
as a rock-solid fortress. We take great initiative in serving as a
center for cooperation, information exchange, and ongoing education.
