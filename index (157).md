## Overview

DefectDojo is a single platform to orchestrate end-to-end security
testing, vulnerability tracking, deduplication, remediation, and
reporting. The project was started in 2013 and the open source version
was released in 2015.

Our open platform transforms security information management, connecting
security strategy and informed execution for intelligent risk
management. Security and DevSecOps teams can aggregate, automate, and
integrate data from more than 200 security tools for a unified view of
security posture and compliance, streamlined workflows, and improved
decision-making.

Automate the tools you currently use, combine findings, and apply
templates for SLAs and mitigation---all tracked to the product or
product groups you define. Track unique vulnerabilities across builds,
releases, endpoints, repositories and engagements. DefectDojo algorithms
learn overtime to automatically group findings and apply changes.

DefectDojo was created by security pros for security pros to provide
maximum results with minimum human intervention.

## Description

DefectDojo streamlines the testing process with a flexible data model
that gives you the ability to iterate and drive immediate value. The
data model has four core components: Product, Engagement, Tests, and
Findings (Endpoints). Additionally, DefectDojo has supplemental models
that facilitate metrics, authentication, report generation, and tools.
DefectDojo is written in Python and Django.

Testing or installing DefectDojo is easy and automated. When you're
ready to set up an instance of Dojo for your organization, we have a
script that handles all dependencies, configures the database, and
creates a super user. Complete installation instructions are found
[here](https://defectdojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/getting_started/installation/).
The project's documentation can be found on the [documenation
site](https://documentation.defectdojo.com/).
