In response to increasing concerns over the effectiveness of the CVE
Program and the sustainability of the U.S. government's role in managing
the world's largest vulnerability database, cybersecurity leaders and
international stakeholders are coming together to explore a federated
model for vulnerability identification. The initiative seeks to address
modern security challenges---such as the shift toward hyper-automation,
the dominance of open-source software, and emerging needs in
cryptography, artificial intelligence, and other specialized
domains---by fostering global collaboration and innovation.

Traditionally OWASP offered in-person instructor led trainings as a part
of Global AppSec Conferences which take place two or three times a year.
However the OWASP Foundation gets requests for more frequent in-person
trainings.

OWASP Education and Training Committee has been working on a set of new
initiatives and one of them is collaborating with Events Committee to
schedule trainings over and above the currently offered trainings in
OWASP Global AppSec.

Welcome to the annual More than a Password Day! To celebrate this year's
event, OWASP is enabling multi-factor authentication across the OWASP
Foundation's infrastructure. This is a significant step forward in
securing our systems and data. At the start of this year's event, we had
only 21% of all OWASP accounts enrolled in MFA. We're aiming to increase
this to 100% by the end of the year.

## [A workaround for OWASP Foundation emails being blocked by Microsoft Office 365](../blog/2024/10/30/owaspfoundation-org-emails.html)

![image](../assets/images/people/staff_andrew.jpg)

Over the last several months, OWASP, particularly the owasp.com domain,
has been blocked from sending messages to tenants of the Microsoft
Office 365 platform or those using Microsoft Defender for Office 365,
where messages end up blacklisted in quarantine or never received.
Organizations that have failed to receive our emails includes legal
firms, our HR firm, our accountants, our European affiliate's
accountants and VAT specialists, and many others, including potential
sponsors, donors, and members.

This is an untenable situation, and extremely disappointing that we have
been unable to resolve this issue with Microsoft. So we have to use a
workaround domain, owaspfoundation.org to send emails to Microsoft 365
tenants. This is not ideal, but we have no other choice. We will never
use owaspfoundation.org for any other purpose other than to get around
this spam filter insanity. We will never send any marketing or other
unsolicited emails from this domain, it will not be linked to our
MailChimp or our accounting system. Only select staff have access to
this domain, and we will only use it when all else fails.

Recently, Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo and other major email providers
have been implementing stricter email authentication controls. This is a
good thing, as it helps to reduce the amount of spam and phishing emails
that we all receive. However, it can also cause problems for legitimate
email senders, such as OWASP. In the last month or so, we have
experienced great difficulty in sending emails to Microsoft email
addresses (Office 365, Exchange Online, Outlook, Hotmail, Live, etc).
This has been a major problem for us, as many of our members and
volunteers use Microsoft email addresses. We have been working hard to
resolve this issue. In this post, we document a solution that every
Microsoft user needs to do to reliably receive our email.

We have created staff accounts on owaspfoundation.org. Our staff will
only let you know how to un-quarantine our emails, with a link to this
blog post, and to ask that you reply to the original email once restored
to your Inbox.

*Software development aimed at selling products in the European Union
will soon change forever. Regardless of whether the product is an IoT
device, a child's toy with embedded software, a server-side application,
or a mobile app - the software will have to be marked with the CE
symbol, which will include cybersecurity aspects on the product. At the
heart of the new regulation, the EU Cyber Resilience Act, is the

The multitude of networked devices contributing the Internet of Things
(IoT) poses new risks for manufacturers, operators, and end users of
solutions. Every IoT device represents potential threats to user data
and supporting infrastructure when a single manipulated device has
potential to endanger an ecosystem. Due to the interconnection of an
array of technologies, standards and protocols, a considerable amount of
effort is necessary to build and maintain a homogeneous level of IoT
security.

To reduce the risk of successful attacks, manufacturers and operators
must periodically assess the security level of their IoT solutions. An
instrument for this purpose is penetration testing such as goal based
security assessments tailored toward target systems. We are excited to
announce that the [OWASP IoT Security Testing
Guide](../www-project-iot-security-testing-guide/index.html) project
published its first release on March 1, 2024. This guide aims to provide
comprehensive insights into testing the security of IoT devices and
systems.

After serving as its steward for over a decade,
[Trustwave](https://www.trustwave.com/) has agreed to transfer the reins
of the renowned open-source web application firewall (WAF) engine,
ModSecurity, to the [Open Worldwide Application Security Project
(OWASP)](../index.html). This landmark move promises to inject fresh
energy and perspectives into the project, ensuring its continued
evolution as a vital line of defense for countless websites worldwide.

The transition, commencing on January 25th, 2024, isn't just about
changing hands. OWASP, the leading open community dedicated to
application security, is already responsible for the Core Rule Set, the

OWASP's Board of Directors approved two additions to our force majeure
policy. OWASP offers free membership to those affected by force majeure
events, such as war. During times of need, the last thing people need to
worry about is paying for membership, so we offer free membership to
those affected. The process to apply for free membership is simple and
straightforward. The two new additions to the force majeure policy are:
Israel and Palestine, joining Ukraine.

### What is shift left security?

Shift-Left Security is the practice of moving security checks as early
and often in the SDLC as possible as part of a DevSecOps shift.
Vulnerabilities found earlier in development are much easier and cheaper
to fix.

The CycloneDX Cryptography Working Group felt that the lack of a
standard for describing cryptographic assets such as algorithms,
certificates, or keys was a good starting point for working with the
CycloneDX community to develop such. As part of our day-to-day work, it
is not only important to have a consistent standard for representing
cryptographic information, but also to establish it as part of a large
ecosystem. Documenting the data and services placed at risk by a
compromised cryptographic system is an investment in faster, more
effective vulnerability response in the future.

Would you trust generative AI with an important cyber security question?

We are super excited to announce the world's first security-specialized
chatbot: the powerful OpenCRE-Chat. Using Google's great conversational
PaLM AI technology, we created a large language model that uses the
standards collected in OpenCRE as main resource for answering questions
about information security. The advantage of this approach is that the
answers are more reliable, since they come from vetted and leading
standards (ISO, NIST, CAPEC, Mitre, OWASP etc.), plus the Chatbot
provides the right references with the answers. In contrast, regular
chatbots typically do not provide references, and they take their
information from the entire internet, which can be a problem if the
answer is an hallucination, or from an unreliable, outdated or even
manipulated source.

## [OWASP API Security Top 10 2023 has been released](../blog/2023/07/03/owasp-api-top10-2023.html)

![image](../assets/images/logos/owasp-api-security-top10.jpg)

API Security Project team

Monday, July 3, 2023

The OWASP API Security Project has just released an updated version of
the OWASP Top 10 for APIs.

A lot has changed in the field of API Security since the first edition
was published four years ago (2019). Updating the list required us to
keep up with new trends and talk to security experts from different
industries to make the information more accessible to everyone.

The 2023 list is a result of the amazing effort put in by the OWASP
community and project contributors.

Here are three new trends from the list:

1.  Authorization remains the biggest challenge in API Security. Three
    out of the top five items are related to authorization (access
    control). Modern API-based applications are becoming increasingly
    complex, with thousands of API endpoints and countless parameters.
    When you add user hierarchies into the mix, it becomes a recipe for
    unpredictable behaviors that may not only hurt the system but also
    organizations' reputation.
2.  We've added a new item called "Unrestricted Access to Sensitive
    Business Flows" to address emerging risks like Scalping and Fake
    Account Creation. This trend highlights the importance of not only
    secure coding but also secure planning and design when building a
    new application. With APIs allowing easy access for bots, it's
    crucial to identify sensitive business flows and choose appropriate
    protection measures.
3.  Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) has been added to the list. While
    SSRF is not a new vulnerability, it has become more prevalent and
    severe in API-based applications. The popularity of web hooks, for
    example, has made it easier for hackers to exploit SSRF
    vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the management/control REST APIs of
    Cloud, K8S, and Docker make exploitation easier.

If you want to learn more, please check [the project
page](../www-project-api-security/index.html) or the [OWASP API Security
Top 10 website](../API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x11-t10/index.html).

OWASP was invited to RSA this year and given both a table in the

there.

The booth in the exhibitor hall was not huge and in traditional OWASP
style it was not ostentatious, however, it did have loads of OWASP
branded swag that turned out to be very popular with the attendees. We
had over a 1,000 conversations at RSA this year and (almost) everyone

We will be deleting old accounts of long-expired members, initially
those that are more than three years out of date. So if you've let your

rise of SBOM and software transparency, there is an equal push to be
transparent about the vulnerabilities and their exploitability in the

OWASP SAMM (Software Assurance Maturity Model) is the OWASP framework to
help your organization assess, formulate, and implement a strategy for
software security that can be integrated into your existing Software
Development Lifecycle (SDLC). OWASP SAMM is fit for most contexts,
whether your organization is mainly developing, outsourcing, or

From time to time, leaders will bring an opportunity to support a
similar organization, such as promoting another organization's event or
seminar, staffing a booth or desk, or running a Capture the Flag event.
Often the leader wants to promote the activity through OWASP's platforms
because, in all likelihood, it will interest OWASP members. We call
these arrangements "co-marketing," and there's a process to getting them
approved so that OWASP is not abused as a free marketing tool by others.

Here's how to get your co-marketing approved quickly and efficiently by
supplying the correct information early. Not all co-marketing will be
approved, as most of the requests we receive are not OWASP-like or
simply trying to abuse OWASP's large audience or as free marketing.

Here's how to get it done:

In order to distinguish [projects](../projects/index.html) more clearly
over their lifecycle, OWASP has introduced a new *Production* maturity
level. It offers a natural and final step for all projects of sufficient
maturity and activity after *Lab* status, and allows to treat *Flagship*
finally as the strategic bonus level it was always meant to be. Along
with the new level, a clear guidance on progression requirements and the
promotion process have been documented by [the Project
Committee](../www-committee-project/index.html).

Over the years, Google has continually leveraged OWASP internally as
well as externally as part of their developer education around Android
and Google Cloud security best practices. This includes presentations at
various conferences such as [Droidcon](https://www.droidcon.com/) and
[online
guidance](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/owasp-top-ten-mitigation)
for Google Cloud. Earlier this year, Google started going a little
further by analyzing OWASP MASVS and ASVS to see if these two standards
can be used more prescriptively within their developer community.

New recommendations drafted by members of OWASP, The Linux Foundation,
Oracle, and others, aim to improve the accuracy of the NVD with a focus
on modern, automated use cases. The group, informally named the "SBOM
Forum", is led by supply chain consultant and blogger, [Tom
Alrich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-alrich-6314055/). Their first
paper titled [A Proposal to Operationalize Component Identification for
Vulnerability
Management](../assets/files/posts/A%20Proposal%20to%20Operationalize%20Component%20Identification%20for%20Vulnerability%20Management.pdf).
recommends that MITRE and the NVD adopt Package URL for the
identification of open source and commercial software along with
multiple GS1 standards for hardware. In doing so, the accuracy of
vulnerability management can be dramatically improved while increasing
the efficiency and effectiveness of the teams doing it.

The OWASP Foundation is currently in the process of updating the bylaws
due to the existing bylaws not being valid. We have received a draft
that we believe is ready to be approved, but we are still waiting upon
the Board to hold an Executive Session on the status of fees and
membership privileges.

Once we have clarity on the status of members' fees and privileges, the
process of ratification can begin.

Sadly, COVID is here to stay. We must learn to live with it. At some

it is now. So it's time to turn the temporary COVID restrictions into
permanent policy. We can always amend, replace, or repeal the policy at
some point in the future. Read on for more information.

to start on July 1, or at the latest in concert with the next Board
Election starting August 15.

Thank you to everyone who participated in the Survey. I am pleased to
announce that the following Members have won a ticket to a Global AppSec
of their choosing:

- Marianne Busch
- Amit Dubey
- David Ochel

We are making progress on both the bylaws and the association management
platform. You can also have a [early sneak peek at our new

On behalf of the [OWASP ASVS](../asvs.html) leadership team, we are
excited to publicise the objectives and roadmap for the upcoming version
5.0 of the flagship OWASP Application Security Project. We are hoping to
be able to release a final version by the end of the year but there is a
lot to do and we need **your** help!

Our first milestone is the **end of May** by when we would like to have
as much feedback as possible on the current standard so as to start
planning how the next version will look.

You may wish to read through [the full objectives and roadmap
document](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/wiki/Roadmap-to-version-5.0) (or
keep reading this post), review the [current "bleeding edge"
version](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/tree/master/5.0/en) of the ASVS
document, and check out our [guide to
contributing](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
which also includes guidance of the process to go through to provide
feedback.

Whilst following that guidance, you are then welcome to respond to
[existing issues](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/issues) or [open a new
issue](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=standard-asvs-issue.md&title=)

Recently, we received legal advice on the upcoming Leaders as Members
bylaw and policy changes. Long story short, we may need eligible OWASP
members to vote to approve a new or updated certificate of incorporation
and bylaws. The required changes are so extensive, that we may need to
replace our bylaws with much newer ones. Therefore, OWASP is consulting
with OWASP Members on our bylaws' membership classes and their rights,
privileges, and powers.

Bylaws and membership rights is both incredibly important and yet
incredibly boring unless you are a policy wonk. To encourage survey
submissions, the OWASP Foundation is offering a prize for three random
OWASP members who complete the survey: a pass to any OWASP Global AppSec
conference held in 2022, including [OWASP 2022 Global AppSec Europe
Virtual Event](https://virtual.globalappsec.org/), [OWASP 2022 Global
AppSec AsiaPac Virtual Event](https://apac.globalappsec.org/), and
[OWASP 2022 Global AppSec San Francisco](https://sf.globalappsec.org/).

## [OWASP Leader Town Halls - Leaders as Members](../blog/2022/03/28/leader-town-hall.html)

Andrew van der Stock

Monday, March 28, 2022

I have scheduled three Leader Town Halls this coming Thursday to cover
all major time zones to discuss the changes required by our new AMS
platform, YourMembership. From an organizational governance perspective,
members are the owners of the organization, and that's why we require
Board members to be paid members. [Leading governance
practices](https://boardsource.org/resources/membership-organization/)
often require that non-members should not be able to make decisions or
lead an organization.

"A formal membership organization is a nonprofit that **grants its
members specific rights to participate in its internal affairs**. These
rights are established in the articles of incorporation and defined in
more detail in the bylaws. Usually in a formal membership organization,
members elect the board and/or the officers; approve changes in the
bylaws; and authorize major transactions such as mergers and dissolution
of the organization. In short, members have a strong interest and voice
in the future of the organization and not only in the tangible benefits
that they may receive as members."

- [BoardSource](https://boardsource.org/resources/membership-organization/)

OWASP is practically unique in currently not requiring leaders be
members since its inception. All the AMS systems we evaluated, and the
one we selected, have a deeply built in requirement that self-service
group (chapter, project, committee, etc) management is reserved for
members, so it is not possible for us to avoid this issue any longer.

There are several ways it could be managed, some better than others.

Over the last few months, many have received a great deal of
communication about their impending email deactivation. For most of the
accounts affected, this is actually what was supposed to have happened a
long time ago, because as members expire, their accounts should be
de-activated. The issue is that some members have multiple records or
incorrect data. This automation is will processing expired memberships
as an on going process. The process will eventually find all incorrect
membership data. This process only deactivates the account, and so it's
very easy for us to get things back on the right track.

We need your help. Our call to action is every member should login to
the [OWASP Membership portal](https://members.owasp.org/) with your
owasp.org email address, review, and as necessary update their
membership data and contact preferences. Please update your membership
record. If you can't login, please [log a support
ticket](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/9).

OWASP's mission is to improve the state of appsec throughout the world.
The war in Ukraine has made us realize that OWASP hasn't sufficiently
defined how we can best assist countries affected by force majeure
events, such as wars, riots, disasters, or extreme weather.

We encourage everyone to assist our Ukrainian members and donate to
non-political aid organizations, such as the International Red Cross. We
ask our community to assist in any way, including donating and
volunteering to provide assistance asked by our Ukrainian leaders and
members. Please tune into #owasp-community on Slack if you can help.

OWASP is mandated by US 501 (c)(3) non-profit regulations to be
non-political. Despite many of us in our community rightly having strong
personal feelings about the war, OWASP is not permitted to make
political statements.

blocker, to understanding how high-performance development teams build
software. AppSecEngineer's online training will help all OWASP members

for this year's coming Global AppSec US 2021 Virtual conference.

OWASP Trainings are historically held in conjunction with Global AppSec
events ahead of conference days. This year, due to the recovery of the
COVID19 pandemic, the Foundation will host the event virtually once
again and is exploring options for the Training Courses to be virtual
with a possible hybrid offering.

## [CVE-2021-35368 - CRS Request Body Bypass](../projects/2021/06/30/crs-security-notification.html)

The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a request body
bypass that abuses trailing pathname information. A backend
vulnerability can thus be exploited despite being protected with the CRS
Web Application Firewall rule set when an application server accepts
additional path info as part of the request URI. All known CRS
installations that offer the predefined CRS rule exclusion packages are
affected. This applies to end-of-life CRS versions 3.1.0, 3.1.1 as well
as the currently supported versions 3.2.0 and 3.3.0. Integrators and
users are advised to upgrade.

OWASP Vancouver, Victoria, and Portland hosted the first AppSec Pacific
Northwest on Saturday. This sold out virtual event featured keynotes
from Kymberlee Price and Jim Manico. Content included builder, breaker,
and defender talks and labs by established and emerging chapter members
and a few of our global community of project leaders. Videos will be
posted soon for those who missed the conference on the AppSecPNW YouTube
channel. Next year will hopefully be in person so be sure to follow
\@pnwseccon on twitter or visit the conference website at pnwcon.com.

The Pacific Northwest chapters want to create an event to highlight our
local membership's talent, build community between our chapters, and
engage the wider OWASP community to come explore our beautiful region.
This year we had to do it virtually because of covid but we consider it
to be a huge success. The organizers got to know each other quite well
in the planning and execution of the event, our volunteers were
rockstars the day of the conference making everything happen, true
talent was displayed through our lineup of speakers, and there clearly
was interest even in spite of zoom fatigue with over 1000 registrants.

**Updated 6/29/2021**

Beginning in July, OWASP will be launching a new Membership Portal. The
portal will display information about your OWASP membership and will
also allow you to edit your personal details. In addition, the portal
will provide links to content that is of interest to members including
certain membership benefits. Be on the lookout for further information
about the upcoming Membership Portal as we get nearer to launch.

Also beginning later in July, as a necessary step to a proper membership
portal, the owasp.org email address inventory will be cleaned up and any
email addresses that do not belong to the following groups of people
will be deactivated within 15 days of removal from all of these groups:

- OWASP Members (having an active one year, two year, or lifetime
  membership)
- Project Leaders
- Chapter Leaders
- Event Leaders
- Committee Leaders

With the announcement today of the US Government's [Executive Order on
"Improving the Nation's
Cybersecurity"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/),
OWASP is working to establish vendor-neutral special interest groups to
help organizations securely share information, rapidly adopt and adapt
existing OWASP standards, projects, and tools such as the OWASP
[Application Security Verification
Standard](../www-project-application-security-verification-standard/index.html),
the [OWASP Mobile Testing
Guide](../www-project-mobile-security-testing-guide/index.html), [OWASP
Dependency Track](../www-project-dependency-track/index.html) to help
secure the software supply chain, [OWASP
SAMM](../www-project-samm/index.html), and the [OWASP Cheat Sheet
Series](../www-project-cheat-sheets/index.html). Adoption of OWASP
standards and tooling can help government agencies, contractors and
vendors rapidly comply with the EO today using OWASP's trusted advice
over the last 20 years, that already exists and is ready to go. There is
more to be built, which is why we want to help industry, vendors,
contractors, and agencies work together to improve the applicability of
these standards to their particular use cases.

Hi all, over the last decade or more, many of us have been organising
OWASP events within our community.

One of the problems we have is that there is no standardised place with
content on how to create a repeatable event, nor is there a central team
of volunteers that the community can reach out to to seek advice when
creating an event.

To solve this and help drive stronger events I propose we form an events
committee. The purpose of this committee would be to offer knowledge
and/or resources to empower volunteers to spread OWASP's message through
hosting events.

This week has been a stark reminder that having a policy against
harassment and abuse is an empty promise if there is not a
fully-functioning process behind it to ensure complaints are heard and
fairly addressed, with egregious violators permanently removed from the
community.

OWASP stands with victims of harassment and abuse and unequivocally
condemns abuse in all of its forms. Our commitment to our community is
to ensure our meetings, activities, and events are a safe space that is
welcoming to all and providing a competent mechanism for victims to
report incidents and receive a swift outcome.

## Veracode Secure Coding Challenge Summary

The Call To Battle Secure Coding challenge brought together developers
and security engineers two weeks ago to show off their secure coding
skills. Using Veracode's Security Labs Enterprise, all of the
contestants worked on patching real OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in
containerized environments, using the languages of their choice. The
more languages a competitor knows, the more points they can score. Out
of the 18 fierce competitors, we had 9 who finished at the top of the
leaderboard with 440 points, but it's also not just about completing the
labs and getting the points, it's also about how fast you can solve each
one.

The [OWASP Software Component Verification Standard](../scvs.html)

participation is essential in helping the project assess the current and
future role that Software Bill of Materials play in the industry.

For those unfamiliar with the project, SCVS seeks to establish a
framework for identifying activities, controls, and best practices,
which can help in identifying and reducing risk in a software supply
chain. Designed to be implemented incrementally, the Software Component
Verification Standard has the following goals:

- Develop a common set of activities, controls, and best-practices that
  can reduce risk in a software supply chain
- Identify a baseline and path to mature software supply chain vigilance

At the end of every month, I review the Temporary COVID Restrictions and

forward to getting back to normal now that there's a vaccine and it
seems to be doing a tremendous job of reducing deaths and
hospitalizations. In the meantime, we still need to be staying safe. To
that end, I've simplified the restrictions *a lot*, and also made it
clear when we can start to return to physical events.

Over the last few years, the [OWASP Dependency-Track
project](../dependencytrack.html) has led an industry shift towards
framing open source risk as a subset of software supply chain risk.
Dependency-Track was one of the first platforms to fully embrace
Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) as a core tenant and design principal.
The project is attributable to the creation of
[CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/), an open source SBOM standard used
by thousands of organizations, referenced by multiple RFCs and related
supply chain initiatives.

Dependency-Track v3 has proven that SBOMs can be created, consumed, and
analyzed at high-velocity in modern build pipelines. And its proven the
value of full-stack transparency for IoT and embedded devices. Based on
feedback from the community, from industry, and from government-led
software transparency efforts, the project has made strategic
enhancements to the software that sets the stage for future capabilities
that are only achievable from the use of SBOMs.

## OWASP is vendor-neutral

OWASP is renowned for being vendor-neutral. It's a key part of our four
core values:

- Open: Everything at OWASP is radically transparent, from our finances
  to our code.
- Innovative: We encourage and support innovation and experiments for
  solutions to software security challenges.
- Global: Anyone around the world is encouraged to participate in the
  OWASP community.
- Integrity: Our community is respectful, supportive, truthful, and
  **vendor-neutral**

That doesn't mean we are vendor hostile, no vendors allowed, no vendor
germs, or anything like that. If you are interested in vendor
neutrality, either as an OWASP community member or as a vendor, please
read on.

Guest post from Simon Bennetts, better known as
[\@psiion](https://twitter.com/psiinon), and the entire [Zap
team](https://twitter.com/zaproxy). \^ ajv

## A Quick Introduction to ZAP

In 2009 I was a Java developer and a pentest on one of my services found
vulnerabilities that I'd never even heard of. I decided that I needed to
learn more about web application security in order to become a better
developer.

I quickly discovered OWASP and started going through the wealth of
material available, but I knew that I learn best by doing things so I
started downloading and playing around with open source security tools.
At that time I was also looking for an open source project to contribute
to, so this seemed the ideal opportunity to combine those two things.
Unfortunately there were not any actively maintained open source web
security tools back then, so I took the plunge, forked Paros Proxy
(which had been taken closed source) and set out to create the
community-led open source project that I wanted to join. Since then ZAP
has gone from strength to strength and we now have a core team and
hundreds of
[contributors](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/credits/).

It's hard to believe it's already December! Along with the holiday
spirit, December brings increased outreach from charities. For many
nonprofits, this is when these organizations receive the bulk of their
funding. Individuals are at their most generous and look for ways to
help others while also ensuring they get all of their tax deductions\*.

In truth, if everyone reading this message right now made a donation to
the OWASP Foundation, we'd have the resources needed to greatly expand
and improve our projects, chapters, materials, tools, documentation,
etc. in 2021.

If the time is right, please take a moment to make a tax-deductible\*
gift to the OWASP Foundation today. Click the button below to give
securely and with ease via credit card.

\*As a public charity (IRS PC category), donations to OWASP are likely
to be tax deductible to many US based individuals and organizations.

The OWASP Web Security Testing Guide team is proud to announce version
4.2 of the Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)! In keeping with a
continuous delivery mindset, this new minor version adds content as well
as improves the existing tests.

In recent years, the Web Security Testing Guide has sought to remain
your foremost open source resource for web application testing. Our
previous release marked a move from a cumbersome wiki platform to the

The OWASP Foundation is a not-for-profit organization providing
open-source projects, tools, documentation, etc., to help security
professionals succeed by improving to keep their company's data secure!
Our open-source materials are supported by the financial contributions
of our Corporate Supporters, and they are fundamentally important to
help us continue to fulfill our mission by providing these resources. As
a Corporate Supporter, supporting the OWASP Foundation demonstrates the
companies commitment to the community, the Foundation, and the entire
AppSec sector.

OWASP strives to provide opportunities to companies with all budget
types so everyone can participate.  That being said, we are happy to
announce that we now offer **discounted Corporate Supporter** rates for
companies in developing regions and discounted rates for start-up
companies!  Qualify, and be one of the first ten companies to [join the
Foundation as a corporate supporter](../supporters/index.html) to
receive a special incentive.

## [Announcing Honorary Lifetime Membership Reform and Complimentary Membership for Active Leaders](../2020/11/06/complimentary.html)

At the October public Board meeting at the Global AppSec 2020 - Virtual,
the Board voted on Honorary Membership and active Leader Complimentary
Membership reform, and these reforms are now live.

For hardworking OWASP community leaders who have done amazing things for
many years, you will finally have a chance of being recognized by the
Foundation and your peers for being a true OWASP hero and upholder of
our values and mission. For active leaders, you will be pleasantly
surprised by a new option available to you.

## What is the problem we're trying to solve?

Typically, for non-profits and charities, the expectation is that
community leaders are members. OWASP is almost unique in that we don't
require Membership to participate or make it mandatory for leaders.

Only 17% of OWASP leaders are members of any sort. The Board felt that
many non-member leaders could not vote or become Board members, so they
were effectively donating their time but could not influence the
Foundation or our mission. At the September face-to-face meeting, the
Board discussed various membership models and decided to offer active
leaders Complimentary membership and reform Honorary Membership.

Recently, our lawyers have reviewed all of our bylaws and contracts.
You'll see the improvements coming through as we bring them online.
However, the lawyers found that we had no provisions to prohibit
participation or funding from US Government Sanctioned Countries. Once
notified, we had to act, as ignorance is not an excuse. The Board has
taken action to resolve this issue, and in the process, we have lost a
chapter and refunded one member.

The future of OWASP is driven by passionate individuals who sit on the
Global Board of Directors. They represent you and are elected by you,
our members. We have just published the [Global Board of Directors
elections timeline and
procedures](../www-board/elections/2020_elections.html).

We ask all members to check that their membership is valid, and
necessary communications settings are correct. I encourage anyone to
stand for the Board if they are passionate about OWASP, and I encourage
every single member to vote.

Lastly, I address the current eligibility issues, what's changing, and
how this year's elections will not be affected by upcoming changes to
our bylaws.

Unlike many other groups in the software and security sector, it is
important to us that our organization is shaped by our community. This
of course is evident in our volunteer led Chapters and Projects along
with a member-elected Board of Directors and now down to our everyday
business policies. In what is planned as an annual effort, the OWASP
Foundation is looking for Members to help us update our Corporate
Policies. We have identified and have developed 16 core policy domains

It is with great pleasure that the OWASP Foundation announces that as
per today, Monday 29th June 2020 we will have a new, full time,
Executive Director (ED), selected from within our own ranks. As per this
date Andrew van der Stock will officially take on the role of the ED for
the Foundation on a permanent basis.

Andrew is well known to many in the OWASP Community for both his hard
work on a number of key OWASP Projects (including the OWASP Top Ten and
the OWASP ASVS) as well as for his time on the Global Board of
Directors, representing the OWASP Community from 2015 to 2018. He brings
years of AppSec experience to the role as well as his breadth of
experience managing organisational units. We are sure he will bring this
to his new role in the Foundation and will be a great ED.

Virtual AppSec Days April 2020 was a hit! Over 1,800 participated in the
week-long event. Highlights included a free lightning conference, 11
training courses, and a 48 hour Capture the Flag competition.

The OWASP Foundation set out to bring the community together and provide
alternative education in these uncertain times. We were able to do this
economically for participants thanks to our generous sponsors, without
whom, this event would not have been possible.

Thank you to Acunetix, DevSecOps Academy, Netsparker, and ZeroNorth!
These sponsors not only helped keep the conference affordable but also
gave away over \$800 in prizes to participants.

from 16 countries. The schedule of those talks is available
[here](../www-community/pages/social/chapters_all_day/schedule/index.html).

The OWASP Leaders List is a mailing list populated by either Chapter or
Project Leaders or folks who previously held those positions. The
mailing list is a busy place and ideas flow there regularly - because
the folks on that list are good folks with great ideas.

Sometimes an idea hits the list that requires real work to happen and
this initiative was one of those fortunately there were plenty of
volunteers to step up and make it happen.

difficult, but considered decision, to postpone the Global AppSec Dublin
set to take place June 15-19.

We take pride in offering a premier experience for our attendees and
sponsors and we can no longer guarantee that event quality. Nor can we
ethically put our community's health and safety at risk. Therefore we
have secured dates at the Convention Center Dublin to hold the Global
AppSec Dublin on **February 15-19, 2021**.

For the better part of the last nine months, a small dedicated team has
been working to complete a project that has been started, restarted,
abandoned, restarted, and then again abandoned: migrating our 7,000 or
so page website curated by over 3,000 content editors from MediaWiki to
GitHub Pages. As I like to now say, "when you spend 15 years digging a
deep hole, don't expect to dig your way out in a week." And in all
honesty this is not the finish line, but the starting line for the OWASP

As the foundation moves toward the migration of the OWASP web presence

still have questions regarding what to move and how to move it.
Essentially, if you have a chapter page or project page and you have not

and what is needed can be found at
