## Introduction

The primary aim of the OWASP Smart Contract Security Verification
Standard (SCSVS) Project is to provide an open security standard for
designing, building, and testing secure smart contracts.

The standard offers guidelines that address the specific security risks
and concerns related to smart contracts, decentralized applications
(dApps) and EVM-based blockchain systems, focusing on the core
principles of security in smart contract development.

Initial Draft Version - 0.0.1

The latest stable version is version 0.0.1 (dated September 2024), which
can be found:

- [OWASP Smart Contract Security Verification Standard 0.0.1 English
  (PDF)](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-smart-contract-security-verification-standard/releases/download/v0.0.1/OWASP_Smart_Contract_Security_Verification_Standard-0.0.1_en.pdf)

The master branch of this repository will always be the "bleeding edge
version," which may have in-progress changes or other edits open.

We gratefully recognize the organizations that have supported the
project either through significant time provision or financially on our

page!

## Standard Objectives

The requirements were developed with the following objectives in mind:

1.  **Develop and Refine Security Guidelines**: Consolidate general
    security practices into a comprehensive set of guidelines for smart
    contract developers and security professionals.
2.  **Address Unique Security Challenges of Smart Contracts**: Focus
    specifically on vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy,
    overflows/underflows, gas optimization, and economic attacks.
3.  **Guide Development Teams in Secure Practices**: Provide detailed
    guidance to developers for implementing secure coding practices in
    smart contract development.
4.  **Assist Security Teams in Audits and Penetration Testing**: Offer
    methodologies for effective smart contract audits and penetration
    testing, including blockchain data integrity, access control, and
    business logic.
5.  **Establish and Update Security Benchmarks**: Create and regularly
    update security benchmarks to reflect the evolving nature of
    blockchain ecosystems and smart contract security.
6.  **Promote Best Practices in Smart Contract Security**: Encourage the
    adoption of best practices, such as defensive coding, formal
    verification, and test-driven development, to secure smart contract
    environments.
7.  **Align Security Expectations Among Stakeholders**: Establish a
    common understanding of security expectations for developers,
    auditors, blockchain platforms, and decentralized finance (DeFi)
    users.

The OWASP SCSVS project was initiated to share the knowledge gained from
the CredShields Security Team's research into Smart Contract security
while developing [**SolidityScan.com**](https://solidityscan.com/), an
AI-powered vulnerability scanner for Smart Contracts. We extend our
gratitude to [**CredShields**](https://credshields.com/) for their
efforts in defining the initial requirements and founding this project.
