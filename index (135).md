INTRODUCTION

The main focus for this project is to explore strategic utilization of
OWASP projects in enterprise with attention on DevSecOps, information
security management systems and infrastructure-as-code.

We will examine the components of DevSecOps, or namely: development
lifecycles, security lifecycles, and business operations and then take a
holistic approach to security program management by investigating the
effectiveness of DevSecOps through the lens of each component.

This project will also explore enterprise security program concepts,
compliance alignment planning, risk management activities, threat
intelligence, vulnerability management, architecture and infrastructure,
performance measurement, continuous monitoring, situational awareness,
and security training.

I chose to lead this project because I am often posed with the question
of what is OWASP, how is it used, and is it just for software
developers? We will explore these questions and more as we set out to
discover why cybersecurity is everyone's responsibility and how security
controls effect policies and governance.

My name is Princeton Brooke and I welcome you along this journey. My
career as a software programmer spans over 30 years. I was 8 years old
when I landed my first job as a programmer for the Cleveland Public
Schools system where I developed and maintained a student database that
was utilized by most of the teachers in my school and was integrated
into the school's office for administrative use. I was 13 when I landed
my next programming gig as a database developer for the Cuyahoga County
Board of Elections.

My passion for strategy alignment for compliance and execution, security
program design, and IT project management was fostered by several
technical lead roles including strategy and compliance focused software
and web developer positions in real-estate, higher education, federal
contracting, and healthcare. It was across these positions that I
experienced the power of teams and the goal of operational dynamics
enabled by information systems.
