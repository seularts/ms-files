### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting June 2025

**When:** Tuesday, June 24, 2025 @ 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM\
Agenda:\
11:30-11:55 -- Room Opens, food is available and in-room discussions\
11:55-12:05 -- Chapter/OWASP info presentation\
12:05-1 -- Speaker Presentation\
\
**Presentation: SAST on Rewind: Moving from Pattern-Matching to
Contextual Security in the Age of AI**

Static analysis was built for yesterday's code. Its rule-based engines
still hunt for familiar strings while AI assistants generate brand-new
logic paths at record speed. The result? False positives everywhere,
real vulnerabilities left open, and developers who treat security
findings like background noise.

In this 40-minute session, James Wickett, CEO & Co-Founder of DryRun
Security, hits "rewind" to show where traditional SAST got stuck---and
fast-forwards to a context-first approach that finally keeps pace with
modern development. Drawing on fresh data from the 2025 SAST Accuracy
Report and real cod stories, James will:

1.  Contrast patterns vs. context --- why deterministic rules miss IDOR,
    broken auth, and AI-generated edge cases.
2.  Unpack probabilistic scanning --- how contextual signals cut noise
    without sacrificing coverage.
3.  Contextual Security Analysis in Action --- a live authorization flaw
    that slipped through regex nets.
4.  Share a plan for AI readiness for AppSec --- tools, projects,
    resources to plan for AI readiness for your appsec or product
    security program.

\
Attendees will leave with open-source resources, clear ROI talking
points for leadership, and a practical roadmap to upgrade their AppSec
program for the AI era---no VHS tape required.\
