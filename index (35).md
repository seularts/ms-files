# Current location

We donated our [Threat Modeling
Playbook](https://www.toreon.com/threat-modeling-playbook/) in markdown
in an OWASP [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/OWASP/threat-modeling-playbook).

# Intro

We aim to improve product and software security with our new OWASP
threat modeling playbook. We consider threat modeling as a foundational
activity to improve your software assurance. We are convinced that a
good threat modeling practice will measurably decrease security issues
of delivered products.

We hope you will use this playbook to improve your threat modeling
practice. We also encourage you to provide feedback to our [OWASP threat
modeling](../www-community/Threat_Modeling.html) community in order to
make this playbook even better in our next release.

I thank our collaborators (in alphabetic order): Jonas Muylaert, Joris
Van den Broeck, Sebastien Deleersnyder, Steven Wierckx and Thomas Heyman
to help us create this first release. I also thank Toreon for its
decision to donate this work to the threat modeling community.
