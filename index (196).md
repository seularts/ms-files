## What is the ASVS?

The OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) Project
provides a basis for testing web application technical security controls
and also provides developers with a list of requirements for secure
development.

## Support the ASVS

For more details on how to financially support the ASVS, see our
[Supporters Page](https://appsecg.host/fundasvs).

## More Details on the ASVS

The primary aim of the **OWASP Application Security Verification
Standard (ASVS) Project** is to normalize the range in the coverage and
level of rigor available in the market when it comes to performing Web
application security verification using a commercially-workable open
standard. The standard provides a basis for testing application
technical security controls, as well as any technical security controls
in the environment, that are relied on to protect against
vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.
This standard can be used to establish a level of confidence in the
security of Web applications. The requirements were developed with the
following objectives in mind:

- **Use as a metric** - Provide application developers and application
  owners with a yardstick with which to assess the degree of trust that
  can be placed in their Web applications,
- **Use as guidance** - Provide guidance to security control developers
  as to what to build into security controls in order to satisfy
  application security requirements, and
- **Use during procurement** - Provide a basis for specifying
  application security verification requirements in contracts.

Get the latest stable version of the ASVS (5.0.0) from the
[Downloads](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/tree/v5.0.0#latest-stable-version---500)
page.

## How To Reference ASVS Requirements

Each requirement has an identifier in the format
`<chapter>.<section>.<requirement>`{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge}, where each element is a number. For example,
`1.11.3`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}.

- The `<chapter>`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge} value
  corresponds to the chapter from which the requirement comes; for
  example, all `1.#.#`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}
  requirements are from the 'Encoding and Sanitization' chapter.
- The `<section>`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge} value
  corresponds to the section within that chapter where the requirement
  appears, for example: all `1.2.#`{.language-plaintext
  .highlighter-rouge} requirements are in the 'Injection Prevention'
  section of the 'Encoding and Sanitization' chapter.
- The `<requirement>`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge} value
  identifies the specific requirement within the chapter and section,
  for example, `1.2.5`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge} which as
  of version 5.0.0 of this standard is:

> Verify that the application protects against OS command injection and
> that operating system calls use parameterized OS queries or use
> contextual command line output encoding.

Since the identifiers may change between versions of the standard, it is
preferable for other documents, reports, or tools to use the following
format:
`v<version>-<chapter>.<section>.<requirement>`{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge}, where: 'version' is the ASVS version tag. For
example: `v5.0.0-1.2.5`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge} would be
understood to mean specifically the 5th requirement in the 'Injection
Prevention' section of the 'Encoding and Sanitization' chapter from
version 5.0.0. (This could be summarized as
`v<version>-<requirement_identifier>`{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge}.)

Note: The `v`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge} preceding the
version number in the format should always be lowercase.

If identifiers are used without including the
`v<version>`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge} element then they
should be assumed to refer to the latest Application Security
Verification Standard content. As the standard grows and changes this
becomes problematic, which is why writers or developers should include
the version element.

ASVS requirement lists are made available in [CSV, JSON, and other
formats](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS) which may be useful for
reference or programmatic use.

You can meet some of the ASVS team and hear about using the ASVS at
OWASP Global AppSec San Francisco 2024 happening between 23-27
September.

\

### Get updated on the ASVS

# OWASP ASVS Community Meetup - Lisbon 2024

![](assets/images/ASVS_Community_Meetup_Lisbon.png){height="400"}

We held a community meetup for the ASVS project as part of Global AppSec
Lisbon on 27th June 2024!

Jim Manico gave the opening keynote to reintroduce the ASVS and the
background behind the project and we had some [other great
talks](#full-agenda) as well!

There was also an update on the current status of the standard and time
allocated to work on the upcoming version 5.0.

You can see full details in the blog post we published about it:
[https://owasp.org/blog/2024/07/03/asvs-community-meetup.html](../blog/2024/07/03/asvs-community-meetup.html)

Additionally, we would love to get more community members involved in
the ASVS and other than working on the standard we also have information
about other volunteering opportunities to help develop and promote the
project! See the "[Get Involved](https://appsecg.host/asvsgetinvolved)"
tab above!.

## Full Agenda

# ASVS Supporters

## Introduction

Within the ASVS project, we gratefully recognise the following
organizations who support the OWASP Application Security Verification
Standard project through monetary donations or allowing contributors to
spend significant time working on the standard as part of their work
with the organization.

We recognise various tiers of support and the amount of time the
supporter is recognised for depends on the supporter level.

On this page and the project web page, we will display the supporter's
logo and link to their website and we will publicise via Social Media as
well.

If you would like to directly become a Primary, Secondary or Tertiary
supporter, you can make a [donation to OWASP](../donate/index.html) of
\$1,000 or more and choose to "restrict your gift". Alternatively, when
you pay your corporate membership you can choose to [allocate part of
your membership fee to the
ASVS](../supporters/benefits.html#corporate-sponsorship-of-participating-projects-or-chapters)
where the allocated amount will govern which level of supporter you
become.

## Maintaining Supporters (through time provision)

Organizations who have allowed contributors to spend significant time
working on the standard as part of their working day with the
organization. This will be evaluated at the sole discretion of the
project leaders. Supporter will be listed 2 years from the end of the
time provision.

# Volunteer for the ASVS

## Building the standard

We are always looking for people to help out with building the standards
and discussing what should be in there.

You can find information on contributing to the standard in the
[Contribution
Guide](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Helping in other ways

We are looking for volunteers to help with the following tasks. We are
working on the ASVS all year around and you should expect to have to
spend a few hours a week working on your tasks on average. Some of the
tasks may be more intensive such as building scripts or GitHub actions.

If any of these roles sound like a good fit for you, please get in
touch! Students and non-tech people are welcome to apply, especially
folks in the community who are trying to get into the security space but
don't know how, as being involved in an OWASP project like this can
provide valuable experience.

The latest list of roles is here:

[Public ASVS jobs
board](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VUgbA1xjwRaOL9o8SYQqoGGrFNNobmid_FGS-ELVAzA)

## ASVS Users

### CREST OWASP Verification Standard (OVS) Programme

The [CREST OWASP OVS
Programme](https://www.crest-approved.org/membership/crest-ovs-programme/)
accredits companies that provide app security testing services to the
application development industry. The testing to be performed is based
on the ASVS (and MASVS) projects.

### App Defense Alliance

The [App Defense Alliance](https://appdefensealliance.dev/) has based
its [Cloud Application Security Assessment
