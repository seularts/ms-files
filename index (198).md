The Application Security Awareness Campaigns will make available sets of
B2 posters that can be put up around your office and images for use in
emails that introduce your engineers to numerous different security
topics and include links to more information.

The objective of the material is to give the engineers a short
introduction to the topic that will leave them wanting to learn more
about it and point them to where they can dig deeper. The posters or
images for emails should be both eye catching and informative.

## Recommendations:

You could strategically position the posters outside meeting rooms, so
that while waiting for the meeting room to free up, engineers could read
the posters. Posters will have QR Codes allowing them to follow up on
their phone and read more about the topic.

You could also reinforce the message with the people who have already
read the poster using the smaller versions of the images in a daily or
bi weekly email newsletter which they could then keep as a handy
reference. This also offers you the means to reach a larger audience of
people working from home and people who simply haven't seen the posters
around the office.

## Roadmap:
