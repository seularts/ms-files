## Local News

- [AppSensor](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-appsensor) headed by
  lead developer and local member [John
  Melton](https://github.com/jtmelton), was selected as a GSOC project.
  This is a very exciting new feature that will pave the way for a
  server/client model of AppSensor

- [SamuraiWTF](https://github.com/SamuraiWTF/samuraiwtf) Co-headed by
  local member and developer [Jason
  Gilliam](https://github.com/JGillam), SamuraiWTF is a framework
  designed for quickly configuring training virtual machines with tools
  and vulnerable application targets. This of this as a base box with a
  specialized package manager. For example, an instructor could use
  SamuraiWTF to easily set up a classroom virtual machine image
  containing OWASP ZAP and OWASP Juice Shop, and then distribute it to
  each student.
