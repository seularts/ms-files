🌐 Event Recap: OWASP KARE is excited to share the incredible success of
our event, VINTRA'24: Cyber Threat Hunt!

𝐄𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐒𝐮𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬:VINTRA'24: Cyber Threat Hunt! 🎉

The OWASP KARE Student Chapter recently organized a highly engaging
event titled Cyber Threat Hunt as part of the Vintra event series. The
competition was designed to test and enhance participants' cybersecurity
skills through two challenging rounds.

•⁠ ⁠The first round, Decrypt Hunt, focused on key cybersecurity concepts,
including \*\*password cracking, \*\*phishing, and \*\*decryption
techniques. •⁠ ⁠The second round involved vulnerable machine cracking,
where participants were tasked with identifying and exploiting
vulnerabilities in a simulated environment.

The event saw the enthusiastic participation of 100 students, who
competed in teams of four. Out of these, 40 students demonstrated
exceptional knowledge and successfully qualified for the second round.

Participants were evaluated by Dr. K. Venkatesh and Dr. Manikumar on the
following key criteria: •⁠ ⁠Security Remediation •⁠ ⁠Efficiency of Exploit •⁠
⁠Vulnerability Discovery •⁠ ⁠Exploitation Skill •⁠ ⁠Clarity of Process

The event was a great success and contributed to building a stronger
foundation of cybersecurity knowledge among the students.
