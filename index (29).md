This project aims to develop an OWASP Top 10 list specifically tailored
to the maritime industry. Currently, maritime cybersecurity lacks
well-defined standards, and this project leverages the OWASP framework
to address this gap.

The project will identify the ten most critical security vulnerabilities
facing the maritime sector:

- Gathering and analyzing existing maritime vulnerability data.
- Prioritizing the most frequent and impactful threats.
- Developing detailed descriptions for each vulnerability in the OWASP
  Top 10 for Maritime list.

This will provide a foundational framework for risk management and
vulnerability mitigation, ultimately strengthening maritime
cybersecurity.

### Road Map

The project will follow a phased approach, with each phase building upon
the previous one:

#### Phase 1:

Data Collection and Analysis: Gather maritime vulnerability data, clean
and analyze it, identify key vulnerabilities and emerging threats.

#### Phase 2:

OWASP Top 10 for Maritime Development: Prioritize vulnerabilities,
develop detailed descriptions for each in the Top 10 list, and finalize
the report.

#### Phase 3:

Deliverables and Outreach: Finalize all project deliverables, prepare
for dissemination of results (presentations, communication strategy),
and raise awareness of the OWASP Top 10 for Maritime list.

### Get Involved

We invite maritime security experts, researchers, and industry
practitioners to contribute to this project. Your expertise is
invaluable in identifying and addressing the most critical security
challenges facing the maritime industry.

We've begun the first phase of our project: gathering data on maritime
security vulnerabilities. We're inviting everyone to contribute publicly
available information to our project. You can upload your data to the
public section of our data collection area.

If you have data that includes sensitive information but can be shared
publicly after removing private details, please upload it to the private
section. We'll review this data to determine if it can be made public.
