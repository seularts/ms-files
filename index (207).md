With the growing interest and adoption of AI technologies, it's critical
to establish a framework that organizations can use to measure and
enhance their AI maturity levels.

In recent months, several AI Maturity Models have emerged, including the
MITRE AI Framework, which highlights the need for structured AI
assessments. Building on this momentum, we are developing the OWASP AI
Maturity Assessment (AIMA), using the Software Assurance Maturity Model
(SAMM) as a foundation.

The AI Maturity Assessment (AIMA) project goal is to empower
organizations to navigate the complexities of artificial intelligence by
providing a structured framework for making informed decisions about
acquiring or developing AI systems. As AI continues to revolutionize
industries, organizations face critical decisions about integrating
these technologies responsibly. AIMA helps them evaluate AI systems'
alignment with ethical principles, security standards, and operational
goals while mitigating risks and ensuring long-term sustainability.

By bridging the gap between high-level AI principles and actionable
implementation strategies, AIMA ensures that organizations not only
adopt AI systems that align with their strategic objectives but also
foster trust and accountability in their AI initiatives.

### OWASP AIMA Project Goals

The OWASP AI Maturity Assessment (AIMA) project aims to provide
organizations with a comprehensive framework to navigate the
complexities of artificial intelligence systems responsibly. As AI
continues to transform industries, organizations face critical
challenges in ensuring that their AI systems are ethical, secure,
transparent, and aligned with both organizational goals and societal
values.

The following goals outline the key objectives of the AIMA project,
emphasizing informed decision-making, risk mitigation, and alignment
with global standards. By addressing these areas, AIMA seeks to empower
organizations to adopt AI technologies that foster innovation while
upholding trust, accountability, and compliance.

1.  **Enable Informed Decision-Making:**
    - Equip organizations with tools and benchmarks to assess whether to
      build or buy AI systems based on their unique needs, capabilities,
      and risk tolerance.
    - Provide a clear framework for evaluating AI systems' compliance
      with ethical, legal, and operational standards.
2.  **Promote Ethical and Responsible AI:**
    - Ensure that AI systems align with societal and organizational
      values, minimizing risks of bias, discrimination, and harm.
    - Translate abstract ethical principles into practical actions that
      guide AI lifecycle management.
3.  **Enhance Security and Risk Management:**
    - Mitigate AI-specific vulnerabilities, such as adversarial attacks
      and data poisoning.
    - Implement proactive risk assessment and response mechanisms to
      ensure operational resilience.
4.  **Foster Transparency and Accountability:**
    - Encourage explainability and traceability in AI decision-making
      processes to build stakeholder trust.
    - Define clear accountability structures and roles for AI
      governance.
5.  **Provide a Roadmap for AI Maturity:**
    - Offer scalable and adaptable guidance for organizations at
      different stages of AI adoption.
    - Support continuous improvement through benchmarking, monitoring,
      and iterative assessments.
6.  **Align with Global Standards and Best Practices:**
    - Integrate principles and methodologies from established frameworks
      such as OWASP SAMM, ISO/IEC AI standards, and ethical AI
      guidelines (e.g., OECD, EU, IEEE).
    - Collaborate with global communities to refine and promote
      responsible AI practices.
7.  **Support Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration:**
    - Bring together technical, legal, ethical, and operational experts
      to address the multifaceted challenges of AI systems.
    - Create a collaborative ecosystem for knowledge sharing and best
      practices.

### Road Map

Phase 1: Initial Draft and Community Engagement (Jan-Feb 2025)

- Set up a dedicated team to support the development and promotion of
  AIMA.
- Launch team engagement initiatives to gather input and foster
  brainstorming sessions, driving collective feedback on the initial
  draft.
- Publish the first draft of the core project framework. This will
  outline the vision, mission, and foundational structure of AIMA.

Phase 2: Framework Development and Pilot Testing (March-May 2025)

- Refine the initial draft based on community feedback, and develop a
  more detailed framework covering the key areas of AI Governance.
- Initiate pilot testing with a selection of organizations to validate
  the framework's effectiveness and gather real-world insights.
- Expand community outreach to build partnerships and secure
  contributions from industry experts.

Phase 3: Presentation and Outreach at OWASP Conferences (June 2025)

- Finalize the initial version of the AIMA framework, incorporating
  feedback and insights from pilot testing.
- Present the AIMA framework at OWASP Conferences to reach a broader
  audience, share findings, and gather further input.
- Host workshops and panel discussions at the conferences to engage with
  security professionals, AI practitioners, and stakeholders, promoting
  broader adoption and community involvement.
