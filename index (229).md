## Welcome

The OWASP University of Guelph chapter is a newly established
student-driven initiative aimed at advancing cybersecurity education and
promoting a culture of security awareness within the university. As part
of the global Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), the chapter
will provide students with opportunities for hands-on learning,
collaboration, and networking in the field of application security.
Through workshops, seminars, and projects aligned with OWASP's mission,
the chapter will empower students to make informed security decisions
and contribute to the development of secure software. This initiative
highlights the University of Guelph's commitment to fostering
cybersecurity skills and supporting the next generation of security
professionals.
