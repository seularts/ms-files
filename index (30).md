The OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications Project aims to
educate developers, designers, architects, managers, and organizations
about the potential security risks when deploying and managing Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI applications. The project
provides a range of resources. Most notably the OWASP Top 10 list for
LLM applications listing the top 10 most critical vulnerabilities often
seen in LLM applications, highlighting their potential impact, ease of
exploitation, and prevalence in real-world applications.

Examples of vulnerabilities include prompt injections, data leakage,
inadequate sandboxing, and unauthorized code execution, among others.
The goal is to raise awareness of these vulnerabilities, suggest
remediation strategies, and ultimately improve the security posture of
LLM applications.

# OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications version 1.1 {#owasp-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications-version-11}

## LLM01: Prompt Injection

Manipulating LLMs via crafted inputs can lead to unauthorized access,
data breaches, and compromised decision-making.

## LLM02: Insecure Output Handling

Neglecting to validate LLM outputs may lead to downstream security
exploits, including code execution that compromises systems and exposes
data.

## LLM03: Training Data Poisoning

Tampered training data can impair LLM models leading to responses that
may compromise security, accuracy, or ethical behavior.

## LLM04: Model Denial of Service

Overloading LLMs with resource-heavy operations can cause service
disruptions and increased costs.

## LLM05: Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

Depending upon compromised components, services or datasets undermine
system integrity, causing data breaches and system failures.

## LLM06: Sensitive Information Disclosure

Failure to protect against disclosure of sensitive information in LLM
outputs can result in legal consequences or a loss of competitive
advantage.

## LLM07: Insecure Plugin Design

LLM plugins processing untrusted inputs and having insufficient access
control risk severe exploits like remote code execution.

## LLM08: Excessive Agency

Granting LLMs unchecked autonomy to take action can lead to unintended
consequences, jeopardizing reliability, privacy, and trust.

## LLM09: Overreliance

Failing to critically assess LLM outputs can lead to compromised
decision making, security vulnerabilities, and legal liabilities.

## LLM10: Model Theft

Unauthorized access to proprietary large language models risks theft,
competitive advantage, and dissemination of sensitive information.
