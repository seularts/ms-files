Welcome to the OWASP page for Security-C4PO, an open-source pentest
reporting tool. Security-C4PO is an open-source web-application for
managing and documenting penetration tests. It aims to streamline and
automate the often time-consuming task of creating comprehensive reports
by providing an intuitive web-based interface that facilitates the
content of the [OWASP TESTING
GUIDE](../www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/index.html).

![C4PO Logo](assets/images/repository-owasp-guide-c4po.png)

## Description

C4PO provides pentesters the perfect solution when it comes to reporting
security vulnerabilities and other risk-related findings. It makes the
pain of copy and paste a thing of the past. The interface is designed to
guide you through your pentests in the style of the OWASP Testing Guide.
Before creating your report we show you a summary through visualizing
findings and their statuses.

Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXVx4BFckmY)!
