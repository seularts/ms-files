## OWASP Benchmark Project

The OWASP Benchmark Project is a Java test suite designed to evaluate
the accuracy, coverage, and speed of automated software vulnerability
detection tools. Without the ability to measure these tools, it is
difficult to understand their strengths and weaknesses, and compare them
to each other.

OWASP Benchmark is a fully runnable open source web application that
contains thousands of exploitable test cases, each mapped to specific
CWEs, which can be analyzed by any type of Application Security Testing
(AST) tool, including SAST, DAST (like OWASP ZAP), and IAST tools. The
intent is that all the vulnerabilities deliberately included in and
scored by the Benchmark are actually exploitable so its a fair test for
any kind of application vulnerability detection tool. The Benchmark also
includes dozens of scorecard generators for numerous open source and
commercial AST tools, and the set of supported tools is growing all the
time.

## Summary

Version 1.2 and forward of the Benchmark is a fully executable web
application, which means it is scannable by any kind of vulnerability
detection tool. v1.2 has been limited to slightly less than 3,000 test
cases, to make it easier for DAST tools to scan it (so it doesn't take
so long and they don't run out of memory, or blow up the size of their
database). The 1.2 release covers the same vulnerability areas that 1.1
covers. The bulk of the work was turning each test case into something
that actually runs correctly and is fully exploitable, and then
generating a UI on top that works in order to turn the test cases into a
real running application.

The test case areas and quantities for the Benchmark releases are:

  Vulnerability Area           \# of Tests in v1.1   \# of Tests in v1.2   CWE Number
  ---------------------------- --------------------- --------------------- ------------
  Command Injection            2708                  251                   78

  Weak Hashing                 1421                  236                   328
  LDAP Injection               736                   59                    90

  XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)   3449                  455                   79
  **Total Test Cases**         **21,041**            **2,740**             Â 

Each Benchmark version comes with a spreadsheet that lists every test
case, the vulnerability category, the CWE number, and the expected
result (true finding/false positive). Look for the file:
expectedresults-VERSION#.csv in the project root directory.

Every test case is:

- an HTTP Servlet
- a true vulnerability or a false positive for a single CWE

## Release History

- Version 1.0 of the Benchmark was released April 15, 2015 and had
  20,983 test cases.
- Version 1.1 of the Benchmark was released May 23, 2015. The 1.1
  release improved on the previous version by making sure that there are
  both true positives and false positives in every vulnerability area.
- Version 1.2 was first released on June 5, 2016 (The 1.2beta was August
  15, 2015). There have been constant tweaks to the v1.2 release since
  then.

## Potential future enhancements:

- All vulnerability types in the OWASP Top 10
- Does the tool find flaws in libraries?
- Does the tool find flaws spanning custom code and libraries?
- Does tool handle web services? REST, XML, GWT, etc?
- Does tool work with different app servers? Java platforms?
- JSPs
- More popular frameworks
- Inversion of control
- Reflection
- Class loading
- Annotations
- Popular UI technologies (e.g., JavaScript frameworks)
- Entirely new languages (C#, Python, etc.)

## Example Test Case

Each test case is a simple Java EE servlet. BenchmarkTest00001 in
version 1.0 of the Benchmark was an LDAP Injection test with the
following metadata in the accompanying BenchmarkTest00001.xml file:

:::: {.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}
::: highlight
``` highlight
  xml
    <test-metadata>
    <category>ldapi</category>
    <test-number>00001</test-number>
    <vulnerability>true</vulnerability>
    <cwe>90</cwe>
    </test-metadata>
```
:::
::::

BenchmarkTest00001.java in the OWASP Benchmark 1.0 simply reads in all
the cookie values, looks for a cookie named "foo", and uses the value of
this cookie when performing an LDAP query. Here's the code for
BenchmarkTest00001.java:

## Introduction

One of the unique things about OWASP Benchmark is that it is very easy
to score a tool's security analysis results against it. Each test case
in Benchmark has a single intentional CWE that is either a True or False
Positive. These are documented in the expectedresults-1.2.csv file. The
project includes automated scorecard generators for dozens of security
tools that can automatically score a tool's results against Benchmark.
The following describes the Benchmark scoring scheme, reporting format,
and how to actually generate Benchmark scores for tools.

## Benchmark Project Scoring Philosophy

Security tools (SAST, DAST, and IAST) are amazing when they find a
complex vulnerability in your code. But with widespread misunderstanding
of the specific vulnerabilities automated tools cover, end users are
often left with a false sense of security.

We are on a quest to measure just how good these tools are at
discovering and properly diagnosing security problems in applications.
We rely on the [long
history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)
of military and medical evaluation of detection technology as a
foundation for our research. Therefore, the test suite tests both real
and fake vulnerabilities.

There are four possible test outcomes in the Benchmark:

1.  Tool correctly identifies a real vulnerability (True Positive - TP)
2.  Tool fails to identify a real vulnerability (False Negative - FN)
3.  Tool correctly ignores a false alarm (True Negative - TN)
4.  Tool fails to ignore a false alarm (False Positive - FP)

We can learn a lot about a tool from these four metrics. Consider a tool
that simply flags every line of code as vulnerable. This tool will
perfectly identify all vulnerabilities! But it will also have 100% false
positives and thus adds no value. Similarly, consider a tool that
reports absolutely nothing. This tool will have zero false positives,
but will also identify zero real vulnerabilities and is also worthless.
You can even imagine a tool that flips a coin to decide whether to
report whether each test case contains a vulnerability. The result would
be 50% true positives and 50% false positives. We need a way to
distinguish valuable security tools from these trivial ones.

If you imagine the line that connects all these points, from 0,0 to
100,100 establishes a line that roughly translates to "random guessing."
The ultimate measure of a security tool is how much better it can do
than this line. The diagram below shows how we will evaluate security
tools against the Benchmark.
![](../../raw.githubusercontent.com/OWASP-Benchmark/BenchmarkJava/master/scorecard/content/benchmark_guide.png)
A point plotted on this chart provides a visual indication of how well a
tool did considering both the True Positives the tool reported, as well
as the False Positives it reported. We also want to compute an
individual score for that point in the range 0 - 100, which we call the
Benchmark Accuracy Score.

The Benchmark Accuracy Score is essentially a [Youden
Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youden%27s_J_statistic), which is a
standard way of summarizing the accuracy of a set of tests. Youden's
index is one of the oldest measures for diagnostic accuracy. It is also
a global measure of a test performance, used for the evaluation of
overall discriminative power of a diagnostic procedure and for
comparison of this test with other tests. Youden's index is calculated
by deducting 1 from the sum of a test's sensitivity and specificity
expressed not as percentage but as a part of a whole number:
(sensitivity + specificity) - 1. For a test with poor diagnostic
accuracy, Youden's index equals 0, and in a perfect test Youden's index
equals 1.

``` highlight
code()
So for example, if a tool has a True Positive Rate (TPR) of .98 (i.e., 98%) 
  and False Positive Rate (FPR) of .05 (i.e., 5%)
Sensitivity = TPR (.98)
Specificity = 1-FPR (.95)
So the Youden Index is (.98+.95) - 1 = .93

And this would equate to a Benchmark score of 93 (since we normalize this to the range 0 - 100)
```
:::
::::

On the graph, the Benchmark Score is the length of the line from the
point down to the diagonal "guessing" line. Note that a Benchmark score
can actually be negative if the point is below the line. This is caused
when the False Positive Rate is actually higher than the True Positive
Rate.

## Generating Benchmark Scores

Anyone can use this Benchmark to evaluate vulnerability detection tools.
The basic steps are:

1.  Download the Benchmark from GitHub
2.  Run your tools against the Benchmark
3.  Run the BenchmarkScore tool on the reports from your tools That's
    it!

Full details on how to do this are at the bottom of the page on the
Quick Start tab.

We encourage both vendors, open-source tools, and end users to verify
their application security tools against the Benchmark. In order to
ensure that the results are fair and useful, we ask that you follow a
few simple rules when publishing results. We won't recognize any results
that aren't easily reproducible:

1.  A description of the default "out-of-the-box" installation, version
    numbers, etc.
2.  Any and all configuration, tailoring, onboarding, etc. performed to
    make the tool run
3.  Any and all changes to default security rules, tests, or checks used
    to achieve the results
4.  Easily reproducible steps to run the tool

## Reporting Format

The Benchmark includes tools to interpret raw tool output, compare it to
the expected results, and generate summary charts and graphs. We use the
following table format in order to capture all the information generated
during the evaluation.

  Security Category                               TP                                                                                                            FN                                                                                                                TN                                                                                                               FP                                                                                                              Total                                 TPR                                                                                                                                                     FPR                                          Score

## Benchmark Validity

To be clear, the Benchmark tests are not exactly like real applications.
The tests are derived from coding patterns observed in real
applications, but the majority of them are considerably simpler than
real applications. That is, most real-world applications will be
considerably harder to successfully analyze than the OWASP Benchmark
Test Suite. Although the tests are based on real code, it is possible
that some tests may have coding patterns that don't occur frequently in
real code.

Remember, we are trying to test the capabilities of the tools and make
them explicit, so that users can make informed decisions about what
tools to use, how to use them, and what results to expect. This is
exactly aligned with the OWASP mission to make application security
visible.

## What is in the Benchmark?

The Benchmark is a Java Maven project. Its primary component is
thousands of test cases (e.g., BenchmarkTest00001.java), each of which
is a single Java servlet that contains a single vulnerability (either a
true positive or false positive). The vulnerabilities span about a dozen
different CWEs currently.

An expectedresults.csv is published with each version of the Benchmark
(e.g., expectedresults-1.2.csv) and it specifically lists the expected
results for each test case. Here's what the first two rows in this file
looks like for version 1.1 of the Benchmark:

``` code()
 # test name     category    real vulnerability  CWE Benchmark version: 1.1  2015-05-22
 BenchmarkTest00001 crypto      TRUE                327
```

This simply means that the first test case is a crypto test case (use of
weak cryptographic algorithms), this is a real vulnerability (as opposed
to a false positive), and this issue maps to CWE 327. It also indicates
this expected results file is for Benchmark version 1.1 (produced May
22, 2015). There is a row in this file for each of the tens of thousands
of test cases in the Benchmark. Each time a new version of the Benchmark
is published, a new corresponding results file is generated and each
test case can be completely different from one version to the next.

The Benchmark also comes with a bunch of different utilities, commands,
and prepackaged open source security analysis tools, all of which can be
executed through Maven goals, including:

- Open source vulnerability detection tools to be run against the
  Benchmark
- A scorecard generator, which computes a scorecard for each of the
  tools you have results files for.

## What Can You Do With the Benchmark?

- Compile all the software in the Benchmark project (e.g., mvn compile)
- Run a static vulnerability analysis tool (SAST) against the Benchmark
  test case code
- Scan a running version of the Benchmark with a dynamic application
  security testing tool (DAST)
  - Instructions on how to run it are provided below
- Generate scorecards for each of the tools you have results for
  - See the Tool Support/Results page for the list of tools the
    Benchmark supports generating scorecards for

## Getting Started

Before downloading or using the Benchmark make sure you have the
following installed and configured properly:

``` Shell
GIT: https://git-scm.com/ or https://github.com/
Maven: https://maven.apache.org/  (Version: 3.2.3 or newer works.)
Java: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html (Java 7 or 8) (64-bit)
```

## Getting, Building, and Running the Benchmark

To download and build everything:

``` Shell
$ git clone https://github.com/OWASP-Benchmark/BenchmarkJava
$ cd BenchmarkJava
$ mvn compile   (This compiles it)
$ runBenchmark.sh/.bat - This compiles and runs it.
```

Then navigate to: https://localhost:8443/benchmark/ to go to its home
page. It uses a self signed SSL certificate, so you'll get a security
warning when you hit the home page.

Note: We have set the Benchmark app to use up to 6 Gig of RAM, which it
may need when it is fully scanned by a DAST scanner. The DAST tool
probably also requires 3+ Gig of RAM. As such, we recommend having a 16
Gig machine if you are going to try to run a full DAST scan. And at
least 4 or ideally 8 Gig if you are going to play around with the
running Benchmark app.

## Using a VM instead

We have several preconstructed VMs or instructions on how to build one
that you can use instead:

- Docker: A Dockerfile is checked into the project here. This Docker
  file should automatically produce a Docker VM with the latest
  Benchmark project files. After you have Docker installed, cd to /VMs
  then run:

  ``` Shell
  ./buildDockerImage.sh --> This builds the Docker Benchmark VM (This will take a WHILE)
  docker images  --> You should see the new benchmark:latest image in the list provided
  # The Benchmark Docker Image only has to be created once. 
  ```

  To run the Benchmark in your Docker VM, just run:

  ``` Shell
  ./runDockerImage.sh  --> This pulls in any updates to Benchmark since the Image was built, builds everything, and starts a remotely accessible Benchmark web app.
  ```

  If successful, you should see this at the end:

  ``` Shell
  [INFO]_[talledLocalContainer] Tomcat 8.x started on port [8443]
  [INFO] Press Ctrl-C to stop the container...
  ```

  Then simply navigate to: https://localhost:8443/benchmark from the
  machine you are running Docker

Or if you want to access from a different machine:

``` Shell
 docker-machine ls (in a different terminal) --> To get IP Docker VM is exporting (e.g., tcp://192.168.99.100:2376)
 Navigate to: https://192.168.99.100:8443/benchmark in your browser (using the above IP as an example)
```

- Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Here's how you set up the Benchmark on an
  AWS VM:

``` Shell
sudo yum install git
sudo yum install maven
sudo yum install mvn
sudo wget http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/dchen/apache-maven/epel-apache-maven.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-apache-maven.repo
sudo sed -i s/\$releasever/6/g /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-apache-maven.repo
sudo yum install -y apache-maven
git clone https://github.com/OWASP-Benchmark/BenchmarkJava
cd benchmark
chmod 755 *.sh
./runBenchmark.sh -- to run it locally on the VM.
./runRemoteAccessibleBenchmark.sh -- to run it so it can be accessed outside the VM (on port 8443).
```

## Running Free Static Analysis Tools Against the Benchmark

There are scripts for running each of the free SAST vulnerability
detection tools included with the Benchmark against the Benchmark test
cases. On Linux, you might have to make them executable (e.g., chmod 755
\*.sh) before you can run them.

Generating Test Results for PMD: ./scripts/runPMD.sh (Linux) or
.\\scripts\\runPMD.bat (Windows)

Generating Test Results for FindBugs: ./scripts/runFindBugs.sh (Linux)
or .\\scripts\\runFindBugs.bat (Windows)

Generating Test Results for FindBugs with the FindSecBugs plugin:
./scripts/runFindSecBugs.sh (Linux) or .\\scripts\\runFindSecBugs.bat
(Windows)

In each case, the script will generate a results file and put it in the
/results directory. For example: Benchmark_1.2-findbugs-v3.0.1-1026.xml

This results file name is carefully constructed to mean the following:
It's a results file against the OWASP Benchmark version 1.2, FindBugs
was the analysis tool, it was version 3.0.1 of FindBugs, and it took
1026 seconds to run the analysis.

NOTE: If you create a results file yourself, by running a commercial
tool for example, you can add the version \# and the compute time to the
filename just like this and the Benchmark Scorecard generator will pick
this information up and include it in the generated scorecard. If you
don't, depending on what metadata is included in the tool results, the
Scorecard generator might do this automatically anyway.

## Generating Scorecards

The scorecard generation application BenchmarkScore is included with the
Benchmark. It parses the output files generated by any of the supported
security tools run against the Benchmark and compares them against the
expected results, and produces a set of web pages that detail the
accuracy and speed of the tools involved. For the list of currently
supported tools, check out the: Tools Support/Results tab. If you are
using a tool that is not yet supported, simply send us a results file
from that tool and we'll write a parser for that tool and add it to the
supported tools list.

The following command will compute a Benchmark scorecard for all the
results files in the /results directory. The generated scorecard is put
into the /scorecard directory.

``` Shell
createScorecard.sh (Linux) or createScorecard.bat (Windows)
```

An example of a real scorecard for some open source tools is provided at
the top of the Tool Support/Results tab so you can see what one looks
like.

We recommend including the Benchmark version number in any results file
name, in order to help prevent mismatches between the expected results
and the actual results files. A tool will not score well against the
wrong expected results.

**Customizing Your Scorecard Generation**

The createScorecard scripts are very simple. They only have one line.
Here's what the 1.2 version looks like:

``` Shell
mvn validate -Pbenchmarkscore -Dexec.args="expectedresults-1.2.csv results"
```

This Maven command simply says to run the BenchmarkScore application,
passing in two parameters. The 1st is the Benchmark expected results
file to compare the tool results against. And the 2nd is the name of the
directory that contains all the results from tools run against that
version of the Benchmark. If you have tool results older than the
current version of the Benchmark, like 1.1 results for example, then you
would do something like this instead:

``` Shell
mvn validate -Pbenchmarkscore -Dexec.args="expectedresults-1.1.csv 1.1_results"
```

To keep things organized, we actually put the expected results file
inside the same results folder for that version of the Benchmark, so our
command looks like this:

``` Shell
mvn validate -Pbenchmarkscore -Dexec.args="1.1_results/expectedresults-1.1.csv 1.1_results"
```

In all cases, the generated scorecard is put in the /scorecard folder.

**WARNING: If you generate results for a commercial tool, be careful who
you distribute it to. Each tool has its own license defining when any
results it produces can be released/made public. It is likely to be
against the terms of a commercial tool's license to publicly release
that tool's score against the OWASP Benchmark. The OWASP Benchmark
project takes no responsibility if someone else releases such results.**
It is for just this reason that the Benchmark project isn't releasing
such results itself.

The results, from several years ago, for 5 free tools, PMD, FindBugs,
FindBugs with the FindSecBugs plugin, SonarQube, and ZAP are available
here against version 1.2 of the Benchmark:
https://github.com/OWASP-Benchmark/BenchmarkJava/blob/master/scorecard/OWASP_Benchmark_Home.html.
You'll have to clone this Git repo and open the file locally. We
included multiple versions of FindSecBugs' and ZAP's results so you can
see the improvements they made finding vulnerabilities in Benchmark.

We have Benchmark results for all the following tools, but haven't
publicly released the results for any commercial tools. However, we
included a 'Commercial Average' page, which includes a summary of
results for 6 commercial SAST tools in 2016 along with anonymous
versions of each SAST tool's scorecard.

The Benchmark can generate results for the following tools:

**Free Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Tools (Both Open
Source and Commercial):**

Many of the free Open Source SAST tools come bundled with Benchmark so
you can run them yourselves. Simply run script/runTOOLNAME.(sh/bat) and
it puts the results into the /results directory automatically. There are
scripts for running PMD, FindBugs, SpotBugs, and FindSecBugs.

Note: We looked into supporting
[Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/) but it has no security
rules, just like PMD. The [fb-contrib FindBugs
plugin](http://fb-contrib.sourceforge.net/) doesn't have any security
rules either. We did test [Error Prone](https://errorprone.info/), and
found that it does report some use of [insecure ciphers
(CWE-327)](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/InsecureCryptoUsage), but
that's it.

We are looking for results for other commercial SAST tools. If you have
a license for any static analysis tool not already listed above and can
run it on Benchmark and send us the results file that would be very
helpful.

If you have a license for any commercial SAST tool, you can also run
them against the Benchmark. Just put your results files in the /results
folder of the project, and then run createScorecards.sh/.bat and it will
generate a scorecard in the /scorecard directory for all the tool
results you have that are currently supported.

**Free Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Tools (Both Open

::: {#sec-scanning_tips .section .page-body .tab-hidden}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

People frequently have difficulty scanning the Benchmark with various
tools due to many reasons, including size of the Benchmark app and its
codebase, and complexity of the tools used. Here is some guidance for
some of the tools we have used to scan the Benchmark. If you've learned
any tricks on how to get better or easier results for a particular tool
against the Benchmark, let us know or update this page directly.

## Generic Tips

Because of the size of the Benchmark, you may need to give your tool
more memory before it starts the scan. If its a Java based tool, you may
want to pass more memory to it like this:

``` Shell
    -Xmx4G (This gives the Java application 4 Gig of memory)
```

## SAST Tools

**Checkmarx**

The Checkmarx SAST Tool (CxSAST) is ready to scan the OWASP Benchmark
out-of-the-box. Please notice that the OWASP Benchmark "hides" some
vulnerabilities in dead code areas, for example:

``` Java
    if (0>1)
    {
      //vulnerable code
    }
```

By default, CxSAST will find these vulnerabilities since Checkmarx
believes that including dead code in the scan results is a SAST best
practice.

Checkmarx's experience shows that security experts expect to find these
types of code vulnerabilities, and demand that their developers fix
them. However, OWASP Benchmark considers the flagging of these
vulnerabilities as False Positives, as a result lowering Checkmarx's
overall score.

Therefore, in order to receive an OWASP score untainted by dead code,
re-configure CxSAST as follows:

1.  Open the CxAudit client for editing Java queries.
2.  Override the "Find_Dead_Code" query.
3.  Add the commented text of the original query to the new override
    query.
4.  Save the queries.

**CodeQL**

To use the CodeQL command line interface (CLI) on Benchmark, first
install CodeQL and its rules databases per:
https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/using-the-codeql-cli/ (i.e.,
codeql and the codeql-repo).

Once this is done, do the following:

- Navigate to the OWASP Benchmark project directory
- \~/PATHTO/codeql/codeql database create owasp-benchmark --languages
  java
- \~/PATHTO/codeql/codeql database analyze owasp-benchmark
  java-security-and-quality.qls --format=sarifv2.1.0
  --output=results/Benchmark-CodeQL.sarif

You can also try different CodeQL query suites other than:
java-code-scanning.qls. To get a list, run: \~/PATHTO/codeql/codeql
database analyze owasp-benchmark --format=sarifv2.1.0
--output=results/Benchmark-CodeQL.sarif. When you do, a usage message
will be displayed. Something like: "No queries were specified ... one of
these query suites might be what you want?" And then a list is
displayed. 5 different query suites starting with 'java-' were listed
when we ran it. We determined that only 2 query suites include their
Weak Random rule (java-security-and-quality.qls and java-lgtm-full.qls).

**Kiuwan Code Security**

Kiuwan Code Security wrote their own instructions for scanning the OWASP
Benchmark. Refer to their [step-by-step
guide](https://www.kiuwan.com/owasp-benchmark-diy/) on the Kiuwan
website.

**Micro Focus (Formerly HP) Fortify**

If you are using the Audit Workbench, you can give it more memory and
make sure you invoke it in 64-bit mode by doing this:

``` Shell
    set AWB_VM_OPTS="-Xmx2G -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"
    export AWB_VM_OPTS="-Xmx2G -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"
    auditworkbench -64
```

We found it was easier to use the Maven support in Fortify to scan the
Benchmark and to do it in 2 phases, translate, and then scan. We did
something like this:

``` Shell
    Translate Phase:
    export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
    export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/HP_Fortify/HP_Fortify_SCA_and_Apps_17.10/bin
    export SCA_VM_OPTS="-Xmx2G -version 1.7"
    mvn sca:clean
    mvn sca:translate

    Scan Phase:
    export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
    export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/HP_Fortify/HP_Fortify_SCA_and_Apps_4.10/bin
    export SCA_VM_OPTS="-Xmx10G -version 1.7"
    mvn sca:scan
```

**PMD**

We include this free tool in the Benchmark and its all dialed in. Simply
run the script: ./script/runPMD.(sh or bat). If you want to run a
different version of PMD, just change its version number in the
Benchmark pom.xml file. (NOTE: PMD doesn't find any security issues. We
include it because its interesting to know that it doesn't.)

**SpotBugs**

We include this free tool in the Benchmark and its all dialed in. Simply
run the script: ./script/runSpotBugs.(sh or bat). If you want to run a
different version of SpotBugs, just change its version number in the
Benchmark pom.xml file.

**SpotBugs with FindSecBugs**

[FindSecurityBugs](https://find-sec-bugs.github.io/) is a great plugin
for SpotBugs that significantly increases the ability for SpotBugs to
find security issues. We include this free tool in the Benchmark and its
all dialed in. Simply run the script: ./script/runFindSecBugs.(sh or
bat). If you want to run a different version of FindSecBugs, just change
the version number of the findsecbugs-plugin artifact in the Benchmark
pom.xml file.

**Xanitizer**

The vendor has written their own guide to [How to Set Up Xanitizer for
OWASP
Benchmark](https://www.xanitizer.com/wp-content/uploads/howtosetupxanitizerforowaspbenchmarkproject.pdf).

## DAST Tools

**Burp Pro**

To scan, first crawl the entire Benchmark. To do a crawl, right click on
Benchmark in the Site Map, select Scan--\>Open scan launcher. Then click
on Crawl and hit OK. Then save the project in case of a crash during the
scan. Then select the /Benchmark URL and invoke: 'Actively scan this
branch'. Prior to all this, you might want to give Burp more RAM before
you start it (e.g., launch it like so: java -Xmx2G -jar
burpsuite_pro.jar).

**ZAP**

ZAP may require additional memory to be able to scan the Benchmark. To
configure the amount of memory:

- Tools --\> Options --\> JVM: Recommend setting to: -Xmx2048m (or
  larger). (Then restart ZAP).

To run ZAP against Benchmark:

1.  Because Benchmark uses Cookies and Headers as sources of attack for
    many test cases: Tools --\> Options --\> Active Scan Input Vectors:
    Then check the HTTP Headers, All Requests, and Cookie Data
    checkboxes and hit OK
2.  Click on Show All Tabs button (if spider tab isn't visible)
3.  Go to Spider tab (the black spider) and click on New Scan button
4.  Enter: https://localhost:8443/benchmark/ into the 'Starting Point'
    box and hit 'Start Scan'
    - Do this again. For some reason it takes 2 passes with the Spider
      before it stops finding more Benchmark endpoints.
5.  When Spider completes, click on 'benchmark' folder in Site Map,
    right click and select: 'Attack --\> Active Scan'
    - It will take several hours, like 3+ to complete (it's actually
      likely to simply freeze before completing the scan - see NOTE:
      below)

For faster active scan you can:

- Disable the ZAP DB log (in ZAP 2.5.0+):
  - Disable it via Options / Database / Recover Log
  - Set it on the command line using "-config
    database.recoverylog=false"
- Disable unnecessary plugins / Technologies: When you launch the Active
  Scan
  - On the Policy tab, disable all plugins except: XSS (Reflected), Path
    Traversal, SQLi, OS Command Injection
  - Go the Technology Tab, disable everything and only enable: MySQL,
    YOUR_OS, Tomcat
  - Note: This 2nd performance improvement step is a bit like cheating
    as you wouldn't do this for a normal site scan. You'd want to leave
    all this on in case these other plugins/technologies are helpful in
    finding more issues. So a fair performance comparison of ZAP to
    other tools would leave all this on.

To generate the ZAP XML results file so you can generate its scorecard:

- Tools \> Options \> Alerts - And set the Max alert instances to like
  500.
- Then: Report \> Generate XML Report... NOTE: Similar to Burp, we can't
  simply run ZAP against the entire Benchmark in one shot. In our
  experience, it eventually freezes/stops scanning. We've had to run it
  against each test area one at a time. If you figure out how to get ZAP
  to scan all of Benchmark in one shot, let us know how you did it!

Things we tried that didn't improve the score:

- AJAX Spider - the traditional spider appears to find all (or 99%) of
  the test cases so the AJAX Spider does not appear to be needed against
  Benchmark v1.2
- XSS (Persistent) - There are 3 of these plugins that run by default.
  There aren't any stored XSS in Benchmark, so you can disable these
  plugins for a faster scan.
- DOM XSS Plugin - This is an optional plugin that didn't seem to find
  any additional XSS issues. There aren't an DOM specific XSS issues in
  Benchmark v1.2, so not surprising.

## IAST Tools

Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) tools work differently
than scanners. IAST tools monitor an application as it runs to identify
application vulnerabilities using context from inside the running
application. Typically these tools run continuously, immediately
notifying users of vulnerabilities, but you can also get a full report
of an entire application. To do this, we simply run the Benchmark
application with an IAST agent and use a crawler to hit all the pages.

**Contrast Assess**

To use Contrast Assess, we simply add the Java agent to the Benchmark
environment and run the BenchmarkCrawler. The entire process should only
take a few minutes. We provided a few scripts, which simply add the
-javaagent:contrast.jar flag to the Benchmark launch configuration. We
have tested on MacOS, Ubuntu, and Windows. Be sure your machine or VM
has at least 4M of memory.

- Ensure your environment has Java, Maven, and git installed, then build
  the Benchmark project

  ``` Shell
      $ git clone https://github.com/OWASP-Benchmark/BenchmarkJava.git
      $ cd Benchmark
      $ mvn compile
  ```

- Download a copy of the Contrast Java Agent configuration file
  (contrast.yaml) from your Contrast TeamServer account and put it in
  the tools/Contrast directory.

  ``` Shell
      $ mv ~/Downloads/contrast.yaml tools/Contrast
  ```

- In Terminal 1, launch the Benchmark application and wait until it
  starts

  ``` Shell
      $ cd tools/Contrast  
      $ ./runBenchmark_wContrast.sh (.bat on Windows)
      [INFO] Scanning for projects...
      [INFO]

  ```

- In Terminal 2, launch the crawler and wait a minute or two for the
  crawl to complete.

  ``` Shell
      $ ./runCrawler.sh (.bat on Windows)
  ```

- A Contrast report has been generated in
  ./tools/Contrast/working/contrast.log. This report will be
  automatically copied (and renamed with version number) to ./results
  directory.

  ``` Shell
      $ more tools/Contrast/working/contrast.log
