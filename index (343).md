### Jay Harris - Putting Flutter in the Gutter: how to reverse engineer flutter applications

[Talk recording coming
soon](https://www.youtube.com/@owaspmanchester3052/featured){rel="noreferrer"}\
\
In the ever-evolving landscape of mobile application development,
Flutter has emerged as a powerful framework, enabling developers to
create cross-platform applications with a single codebase. However, with
innovation comes the need for robust security measures. This talk aims
to delve into the realm of reverse engineering and security assessment
specific to Flutter mobile applications. Reverse engineering, the
process of dissecting and understanding the inner workings of an
application, is a double-edged sword. While developers leverage it for
debugging and optimization, adversaries exploit it to identify
vulnerabilities and potential security weaknesses. In this presentation,
we will explore various reverse engineering techniques tailored to
Flutter apps, shedding light on the underlying architecture and
highlighting potential attack vectors.\

### Talks

### Stuart Crawford - AppSec in the Enterprise: in-flight testing and Shifting Left

[Talk
recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SHJBKGCu_4){rel="noreferrer"}\
\
In a world where web-based applications are ubiquitous, penetration
testing is well-established as a way of verifying those applications are
secure, but how do we stop finding ourselves falling into an endless
cycle of \'deploy, test, fix\'? The answer is by paying closer attention
to security in the development lifecycle, and I\'ll provide an example
of how we\'re doing this at one of, if not the largest Independent
Software Vendors in the UK\
\
**About Stuart Crawford**\
Stuart is Appsec program manager at one of the largest SaaS companies in

\

### Talks

### Dr Katie Paxton-Fear: Go Hack Yourself: API hacking for beginners

[Talk
recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og7va5eb8UU){rel="noreferrer"}\
\
Over the past few years, we\'ve really seen API hacking take off as a
field of its own, diverging from typical web app security, but yet
parallel to it. Often we point to the amorphous blob that is web
security and go: \"here you go, now you can be a hacker too\", with top
10 lists, write-ups, conference talks and whitepapers smiling as we do.
This creates a major challenge for developers who want to test their
APIs for security or just people who want to get into API hacking, how
on earth do you wade through all the general web security to get to the
meat of API hacking, what do you even need to know? This talk is going
to break down API hacking from a developer point of view, teaching you
everything you need to know about API hacking, from the bugs you can
find and to the impact you can cause, to how you can easily test your
own work or review your peers. So what are you waiting for join me and
go hack yourself!\
\
**About Dr Katie Paxton-Fear**\
A lecturer in Cyber Security at Manchester Metropolitan University and a
cyber security researcher, but she\'s far more well known for her hobby.
In her free time, she\'s a hacker, specialising in API hacking teaching
others through her YouTube videos. A former developer turned hacker, she
used to make RESTful APIs and now she breaks them. She found her first
API vulnerability in 2019 which affected Uber and since then she has
been hacking APIs ever since, creating hours of content to help others
follow in her footsteps. With her PhD in cyber security and machine
learning, she loves to introduce a data-driven approach to hacking
combining new tools with manual testing to ensure an impactful bug
report every time.\
\

### Gerald Benischke - Application DoS vulnerabilities

[Talk
recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2o4m-eE-io){rel="noreferrer"}\
\
This AppSec-focussed talk demonstrates how denial of service attacks can
be carried out without throwing lots and lots of traffic at a system and
effectively stop services. This uses a couple of vulnerabilities in the
play framework as an example and describes the impact. This approach can
be likened to using precision guided missiles rather than the carpet
bombing of DDoS attacks. I will explore the role that convenience for
developers in frameworks combined with unexpected payloads and how this
can be exploited. I also draw on how the service mesh can amplify this
attack such that multiple instances can be killed with a single request.
Furthermore, we look at how Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) offer no
protection against this type of attack. Lastly, I will look at what can
be done to protect applications against this type of attack.\
\
**About Gerald Benischke**\
I tend to describe myself as both an Agile Fundamentalist and an AppSec
Snooper. What does this mean? On the one hand my software development
experience has led me to think that the principles of the agile
manifesto form the basis of good practices. It boils down to lots of
common sense, small steps, learning along the way, not writing code that
nobody will want or need and taking processes and procedures with a
pinch of salt.\
