### Description

The Secure Coding Dojo is a training platform which can be customized to
integrate with custom vulnerable websites and other CTF challenges. The
project was initially developed at Trend Micro and was donated to OWASP
in 2021.

Here are some of the features:

- Integrates with Enterprise environments using Slack, Google and LDAP
  for authentication
- It allows grouping of participants according to their development
  teams
- It allows teams to track progress and compete with each other
- Each lesson is built as an attack/defence pair. Developers can observe
  the software weaknesses by conducting the attack and after solving the
  challenge they learn about the associated software defenses
- Predefined lessons are based on the MITRE most dangerous software
  errors (also known as SANS 25) so the focus is on software errors
  rather than attack techniques
- The predefined hacking challenges are created for entry level and keep
  the developers engaged. Only a browser is needed.
- With CTFs there is a puzzle aspect to the challenges which is great
  for pen-tester audiences but can make some developers lose interest.
  In the Secure Coding Dojo the focus is on demonstrating the
  vulnerability.
- There are tips that help the developers as they are exploiting the
  issue to avoid getting stuck

### Hosted by OWASP

<https://securecodingdojo.owasp.org/>

### Host it locally

The following steps will get you the basic configuration for the Dojo.
For advanced configuration and integrations check the
[wiki](https://github.com/trendmicro/SecureCodingDojo/wiki/Deploying-with-Docker)

- Install Docker latest version.

- Git clone the repository

- Change directory to the repo root directory

- Configure an environment variable DATA_DIR as a mount point for the
  dojo files. On \*nix/mac modify .bash_profile as follows

  `export DATA_DIR="/YOUR_DATA_DIR"`{.language-plaintext
  .highlighter-rouge}

- On Mac you must allow Docker access to this directory in Docker \>
  Preferences \> File Sharing

- Restart your terminal

- Run with

  `docker-compose up`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}

### Running a Secure Coding Workshop using the Dojo

Bringing Software Security training to schools can have a positive
impact on the security of future software. The Secure Coding Dojo
project was created to bring knowledge about software weaknesses and
security best practices to classrooms of all sizes: from universities to
large companies. This workshop package is intended to facilitate
security advocates to deliver training sessions using the dojo.

The workshop package is based on an event organized by the OWASP Ottawa
Chapter and Secure that Cert at the University of Ottawa. Special thanks
to the workshop organizers: Nancy Gariche, Garth Boyd, Miguel Garzon,
Abdulwahaab Ahmed, Scott Kelly and Dave Petrasovic.

### Package Contents

The following resources are being provided with the package:

- Prerequisites
- Suggested agenda and workshop structure
- Presentation material
- Recording of a lecture at the University of Ottawa using the
  presentation material
- Dojo deployment instructions

### Prerequisites

Students will be asked to bring the following:

- Laptop with Internet access
- Optional: Docker and latest version of the Secure Coding Dojo per the
  install instructions below.
- Browser: Chrome or Firefox latest version
- No other software is required.

Organizers should consider the following:

- Event planning platform
- Room size based on registration
- AV and Internet access for participants
- Consider hosting for the Secure Coding Dojo platform: cloud account,
  host names, certificates
- Workshop staff. 1 tutor to 50 students. Workshop staff should complete
  all exercises in advance and be familiar with the content.
- Catering if applicable

### Suggested Agenda

The following agenda is based on a full day workshop including lecture.

- 10:00 Registration
- 10:30 Lecture: Attack-Grams
- 11:00 Lecture: Secure Coding Practices
- 12:00 Lunch break
- 12:30 Dojo Practice Setup, Accounts, Urls
- 13:00 Dojo Practice: Security Code Review Master Module
- 13:30 Dojo Practice: Secure Coding Dojo Black Belt Module
- 17:00 End of workshop

### Presentation Material

Slides for the lecture portion are available
[here](https://github.com/trendmicro/SecureCodingDojo/tree/master/workshop)
and can be distributed under the licensing of this project. Please give
credit to the content creator and graphics creators.

### Lecture Recording

A lecture recording using the provided presentation material can be
found at the following
[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ghIH_Myu4U&feature=youtu.be&t=929)

### Deploying Secure Coding Dojo

The Secure Coding Dojo runs from Docker containers. Students could
easily deploy their own instance using docker-compose as described
below. Deploying a common permanent production instance of the Dojo
requires a bit more setup with instructions available on the
[wiki](https://github.com/trendmicro/SecureCodingDojo/wiki/Deploying-with-Docker)
.

You may also find useful the AppSec DC 2019 presentation of the project:
[AppSeC
Presentation](https://github.com/trendmicro/SecureCodingDojo/tree/master/AppSecDC%20Secure%20Coding%20Dojo%20Presentation)

Costs for a permanent deployment may vary from \$30/month to more
depending on the number of participants.

#### Basic Setup

- Install Docker latest version.

- Git clone the repository

- Change directory to the repo root directory

- Configure an environment variable DATA_DIR as a mount point for the
  dojo files. On \*nix/mac modify .bash_profile as follows

  `export DATA_DIR="/YOUR_DATA_DIR"`{.language-plaintext
  .highlighter-rouge}

- On Mac you must allow Docker access to this directory in Docker \>
  Preferences \> File Sharing

- Restart your terminal

- Run with

  `docker-compose up`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}
