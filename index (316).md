The OWASP Northern Virginia Chapter meetings are FREE and OPEN to anyone
interested in learning more about application security. We encourage
individuals to provide knowledge transfer via hands-on training and
presentations of specific OWASP projects and research topics and sharing
SDLC knowledge. The chapter is committed to providing an engaging
experience for a variety of audience types ranging from local students
and those beginning in Application Security, to those experienced and
accomplished professionals who are looking for competent collaborators
for OWASP-related projects. To this end, we will continue to conduct
monthly chapter meetings application security topics.

Please review our schedule at
[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Northern-Virginia-Chapter/) for
upcoming talks.
