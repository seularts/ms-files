## Welcome

Welcome to OWASP Nagpur Chapter.

## Participation

The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit
foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our
projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to
anyone interested in improving application security.

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapter
Policy](../www-policy/index.html). Financial contributions should only
be made online using the authorized online donation button. To be a
SPEAKER at ANY OWASP Chapter in the world simply review the [speaker
agreement](../www-policy/index.html) and then contact the local chapter
leader with details of what OWASP Project, independent research, or
related software security topic you would like to present.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our
[Projects](../projects/index.html), [Local
Chapters](../chapters/index.html), [Events](../events/index.html),
[Online Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/), and [Community
Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/). We especially encourage
diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is a fantastic place to learn
about application security, to network, and even to build your
reputation as an expert. We also encourage you to be [become a
member](../membership) or consider a [donation](../donate/index.html) to
support our ongoing work.

## Upcoming Events
