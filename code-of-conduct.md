- Comply with the highest ethical principles
- Not engage in any activity that results or reasonably could be
  expected to result in liability or harm to OWASP or cause OWASP to

  including as a result of activities such as use of OWASP materials,
  publications, or software developed in a OWASP project, or your
  involvement in any OWASP activities
- Maintain appropriate confidentiality of proprietary or otherwise
  sensitive information encountered in the course of any OWASP
  activities

  or in part, without proper attribution or permission
- Abide by all provisions in all applicable OWASP organizational
  documents, agreements, and policies
- Not engage in harassment or any other intimidating, discriminatory,
  abusive, derogatory, or demeaning behavior, conduct, communications or
  actions. "Harassment" includes, but is not limited to, any behavior,
  conduct, communication or action that a reasonable person in similar
  circumstances would consider unwelcome, intimidating, hostile,
  threatening, violent, abusive or offensive, and may be related to
  gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
  disability, national origin, race, age, religion or other matters;
  "harassment" also includes stalking, unwelcome following, harassing

  interest. For more information, please refer to the Conflict of
  Interest Policy.

## Reporting violations of this code of conduct

If a participant, member, Director or staff member has violated this
code of conduct, please refer to the Whistleblower and Anti-Retaliation
Policy to report the issue to a Compliance Officer or the Executive
Director.

## Sanctions

The Executive Director can suspend participation in OWASP for up to 30
days for perceived or actual breaches of this Code of Conduct or
applicable law. Depending on the severity of the breach, the member or
participant may be subject to longer suspension or other sanctions,
including termination of participation or membership, by decision of the
OWASP Board of Directors ("Board").

**For first time Code of Conduct breaches, where no violation of
applicable law has occurred:**

The member or participant may be subject to temporary suspension imposed
by the Executive Director for all OWASP participation for up to 30 days.
Membership will not be extended to cover the suspension.

**For repeat or serious breaches of the Code of Conduct, or where a
participant has been charged with a crime:**

The Executive Director must suspend the member and refer the matter to
the Compliance Team. The Compliance Team will then independently
evaluate the matter and recommend to the Board either no action or
proposed sanctions, which may include (but are not limited to)
revocation of leadership position(s), participation, membership
privileges and/or membership. The initial suspension will remain in
place until after the Board votes on the matter.

If the Board decides to take no action: (a) full participation will be
reinstated and (b) if the suspended participant was a member, their
membership will be extended for a period equal to the duration of the
suspension.

## Transparency and Oversight

To provide transparency and oversight, the Executive Director will
inform the Board of the actions being taken in connection with
sanctions, including by informing the Compliance Team as required,
providing applicable Compliance Team recommendations to the Board, and
in concert with the Board, scheduling a Board vote as necessary.
Referrals, reports, recommendations, and decisions made by the Executive
Director, Compliance Team, or Board will be stored and kept confidential
for a period of seven years.
