## What is ESAPI?

ESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API) is a free, open source, web
application security control library that makes it easier for
programmers to write lower-risk applications. The ESAPI libraries are
designed to make it easier for programmers to retrofit security into
existing applications. The ESAPI libraries also serve as a solid
foundation for new development.

Allowing for language-specific differences, all OWASP ESAPI versions
have the same basic design:

- **There is a set of security control interfaces.** They define for
  example types of parameters that are passed to types of security
  controls.
- **There is a reference implementation for each security control.** The
  logic is not organization‐specific and the logic is not
  application‐specific. An example: string‐based input validation. (Note
  that some of the reference implementations are simply "toy" examples
  to illustrate how to implement a specific interface \[e.g., ESAPI for
  Java's `org.owasp.esapi.reference.FileBasedAuthenticator`\] whereas
  others are full-fledged enterprise ready reference implementations
  \[e.g., `org.owasp.esapi.reference.DefaultEncoder` or
  `org.owasp.esapi.reference.DefaultValidator`\].)
- **There are optionally your own implementations for each security
  control.** There may be application logic contained in these classes
  which may be developed by or for your organization. An example:
  enterprise authentication.

## What I did with ESAPI

- I used ESAPI for Java with Google AppEngine. I used it for simple
  validation and encoding.
  --[Jeff](../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#86ece3e0e0a8f1efeaeaefe7ebf5c6e9f1e7f5f6a8e9f4e1)

- I used ESAPI for PHP with a custom web 2.0 corporate knowledge
  management application, made up of many open source and commercial
  applications integrated to work together. I added an organization- and
  application-specific "Adapter" control to wrap calls to the other
  ESAPI controls.
  --[Mike](../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#bbd6d2d0de95d9d4d9dec9c8d0d2fbd4ccdac8cb95d4c9dc)

- I used ESAPI for Java's "Logger" control to make it easier for a US
  Government customer to meet C\\&A requirements.
  --[Dave](../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#55313423307b223c363d302726153a223426257b3a2732)

- I used ESAPI for Java to build a low risk web application that was
  over 250,000+ lines of code in size.
  --[Jim](../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#dab0b3b7f4b7bbb4b3b9b59ab5adbba9aaf4b5a8bd)

- I used ESAPI for Java's "Authenticator" to replace a spaghetti-like
  mechanism in a legacy financial services web application. In hindsight
  I should have used the application-specific "Adapter" pattern
  mentioned by Mike above. The organization also uses the ESAPI
  Encryptor as an interface to a hardware security module.
  --[Roman](../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#01736e6c606f2f697472756065417860696e6e2f626e6c)

- I use ESAPI to be our security package for all our product, this way
  we can set one standard for all products.
  --[Yair](../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#621b030b1010220e0b1407120710110d0c4c010d0f)

- I use ESAPI for Java to educate developers about application security
  principals at several of the world's largest organizations.

## Should I use ESAPI?

\[NOTE: The heretical opinions on this ESAPI tab are 100% my own and do
not necessarily reflect the rest of other ESAPI contributors / creators,
or the OWASP Foundation staff, leadership, community. --kevin wall\]

Or, specifically, "Should I use ESAPI for Java (Legacy)?" since that's
the only one run by OWASP that still shows any semblance of life. While
maintenance activities are down compared to ESAPI's peak development
years and there is no new significant functionality planned (although we
did recently add support for SLF4J in the ESAPI Logger), it is not
completely abandoned as rumor would have it. A few of us are still
regularly working on ESAPI and haven't given up, although we certain
could use some additional volunteers to help out. But without additional
active contributors, ESAPI makes slow progress in terms of bug fixing.

The first question to ask is, are you already using ESAPI in your
project, and if so, do you have a lot vested in it? If so, then the
answer to "Should I use ESAPI?" probably is "yes". The second question
you should ask, if I'm using it, why am I not contributing to it in some
manner? But we won't go there. ;-)

### Potential alternatives to ESAPI

If you are starting out on a new project or trying for the first time to
secure an existing project, then *before* you consider ESAPI, you should
consider these possible alternatives:

- Output encoding: [OWASP Java Encoder
  Project](../www-project-java-encoder/index.html)
- General HTML sanitization: [OWASP Java HTML
  Sanitizer](../www-project-java-html-sanitizer/index.html)
- Validation: [JSR-303/JSR-349 Bean
  Validation](http://beanvalidation.org/)
- Strong cryptography: [Google Tink](https://github.com/google/tink),
  [Keyczar](https://github.com/google/keyczar)
- Authentication / authorization: [Apache
  Shiro](https://shiro.apache.org/), [Authentication using Spring
  Security](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=using+%22spring+security%22+authentication&atb=v203-1&ia=web)
- CSRF protection: [OWASP CSRFGuard
  Project](../www-project-csrfguard/index.html) or [OWASP CSRFProtector
  Project](../www-project-csrfprotector.html)

if *might* make sense to use ESAPI if you plan use multiple security
controls provided by ESAPI (e.g., you plan on using an output encoder to
prevent XSS, data validation, HTML sanitization, and safe logging), then
ESAPI possibly makes more sense to use than 3 or 4 other disparate class
libraries, which provide but a single security control. That is an
engineering decision your development team will need to make.

But most (perhaps 90% or more) of the ESAPI use which I have observed
was solely limited to using ESAPI's Encoder to remediate XSS
vulnerabilities. If that is all that you intend to do with ESAPI, steer
clear and use [OWASP Java Encoder
Project](../www-project-java-encoder/index.html) instead.

A final note: If you want to use ESAPI for authentication /
authorization, keep in mind that ESAPI's reference implementation of
those are "flat file based" and will not scale to enterprise levels.
Those 2 reference implementations are more or less intended as 1)
instructional models so show fundamental implementation ideas, and 2)
provided so we could do unit testing that we otherwise would not be able
to accomplishment without some reference implementation. That said,
writing a RDBMS implementation or an LDAP implementation should not be
rocket science.

### Is ESAPI "safe" to use?

#### A brief history

Note that none of the above recommended alternatives are meant to
suggest that ESAPI is dead, but rather to acknowledge the fact that it
isn't being as well-maintained as most F500 companies would like for
their enterprise software.

In the past, ESAPI had gathered the reputation that it was not well
maintained, but that's not the whole story. There were a few of us who
were actively fixing bugs (including updating dependencies), but because
no one had instructions of how to upload a new release to Maven Central,
we couldn't make official releases available to the public unless they
were willing to get them from our GitHub 'develop' branch where the
fixes were being applied. Despite me pleading for help, none arrived
until 2Q-2019. Since that time, there have been 7 *official* releases
(see https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.owasp.esapi/esapi for a
complete list).

#### Concerns about vulnerable ESAPI dependencies are usually over-hyped

Despite that, I still see objections that the ESAPI development team is
still not responsive enough to new vulnerabilities discovered in its
dependencies. Let me respond to that.

1.  I get security alerts from both Snyk and GitHub as well as regularly
    using OWASP Dependency Check in our build process to stay on top of
    vulnerabilities in library dependencies. In addition, the ever
    astute ESAPI user community regularly emails the ESAPI co-leaders
    notices of new CVEs that might affect ESAPI.
2.  When I become aware of a new CVE in an ESAPI dependency, whether
    that it is in a direct or transitive dependency, I attempt to
    research it to see if it leads to an *exploitable* path to those
    using ESAPI. Usually that means digging through the source code of
    the affected dependency and looking at the commits that fixed the
    problem. As it turns out, vulnerabilities in ESAPI dependencies
    rarely to lead to exploitable paths via ESAPI, but if it does, the
    ESAPI team discusses it, and either upgrades or prepares a
    workaround. And if that is not possible, we will put usually will
    put out an announcement on our Google groups mailing lists and
    prepare a security bulletin, such as this
    [one](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/ESAPI-security-bulletin2.pdf)
    for CVE-2019-17571 in Log4J 1.x.
3.  If users of ESAPI are overly concerned, then can generally edit
    their Maven or Gradle, etc. configuration file to exclude the
    vulnerable dependency and use an updated one that has patched
    whatever CVE. This does not require a Ph.D. in quantum physics; any
    developer with a clue (or knowing how to use Stack Overflow :) ought
    to be able to figure this out. There may be some rare cases where
    this is not possible and breaks their tests, but if that is the
    case, it means that ESAPI generally would not be able to upgrade
    either. (Note because ESAPI currently has a minimal baseline
    dependency of Java 7, there are times when we cannot upgrade to
    later versions of dependencies because they require Java 8 or later.
    That is rare, but could happen. Of course, if your application is
    stuck using Java 7, then CVEs in ESAPI dependencies probably should
    be the least of your worries.)

#### If you are still concerned about support...

There used to be, and probably still are, companies from which you can
purchase ESAPI support. I am not going to list such companies here in
order to remain vendor neutral. If you are searching for, and unable to
locate, one, then contact me privately via email and I will provide you
with a few pointers.

### So why then are you against recommending ESAPI?

At one point when I originally created this 'tab' on the OWASP ESAPI
'wiki', my primary motivation of recommending other security
alternatives to ESAPI was indeed because I felt that we could not
adequately support it because I had not yet figured out how to do a
release, but having now done a couple of releases to Maven Central and
having written down detailed documentation, that is no longer my concern
for recommending alternatives.

So if not that, then why steer people clear of ESAPI 2.x? Glad you
asked. There are two primary reasons:

1.  ESAPI's monolithic architecture means that your project will
    probably unnecessarily pull in lots of dependencies that are not
    actually needed, which in turn leads to more bloated application
    deployments. Maybe that's not an issue everywhere, especially if
    your application war file is in the GB range, but I grew up in the
    day when Bill Gates told us that 640Kb ought to be enough RAM for
    anybody and I foolishly believed him. Given that the latest ESAPI
    jar is a tad over 450Kb, that doesn't leave much room for its
    dependent jars, much less for the rest of your application. :) So,
    in part, its a personal crusade against software bloat.
2.  It is going to be a difficult path forward to ESAPI 3 for those
    applications using ESAPI 2.x. To decouple things and be able to
    package major functionality into separate ESAPI jars (for instance,
    there likely will be an esapi3-core jar and an esapi3-encoder jar,
    etc.), we likely will break some existing interfaces. We won't do
    that intentionally, but the main goal will not be to preserve
    backward compatibility. The fact of the matter is, I don't think any
    of the active ESAPI 2.x contributors wants to spend their time on
    mailing lists or Stack Overflow or at their companies advising
    application development teams on the best way of migrating from
    ESAPI 2.x to ESAPI 3. So the less projects that are on ESAPI 2 now,
    the better it will be for us when ESAPI 3 finally does arrive. It's
    somewhat of a selfish reason, but application developers themselves
    should be selfish in the same sense about the future maintainability
    of their code. We certainly will not needlessly (at least as I'm a
    project co-lead) deviate from the ESAPI 2.x interfaces and its
    current semantic behavior, but at this point, I cannot promise
    anything. I personally think many of the current ESAPI 2 interfaces
    are too bloated and confusing and need to be "broken apart" because
    the current structure ultimately leads to confusion on the part of
    developers and is an impediment to learning the ESAPI SDK. Therefore
    we will, in fact, not be hesitant to change such things. In the end,
    the transition from ESAPI 2 to ESAPI 3 may be easy, but it almost
    certainly will NOT be seamless and could end up being a royal PITA,
    much like the transition from Struts 1 to Struts 2. No promises at
    this point.

### Closing thoughts

It is not a perfect world that we live in, but I would be remiss as an
AppSec guy if I were to plug ESAPI over other good security solutions
simply because of my contributions to / involvement with ESAPI. I think
that ESAPI has its place and I will do my best to maintain it, but not
to the exclusion of my family or day job and I don't expect that of the
other ESAPI contributors either. However, if you would like to volunteer
to help, you know where to find me.

## Glossary

**ESAPI Terminology**

- **adapter** - There are optionally your own implementations for each
  security control. There may be application logic contained in these
  classes which may be developed by or for your organization. The logic
  may be organization-specific and/or application-specific. There may be
  proprietary information or logic contained in these classes which may
  be developed by or for your organization.
- **built-in singleton design pattern** - The "built-in" singleton
  design pattern refers to the replacement of security control reference
  implementations with your own implementations. ESAPI interfaces are
  otherwise left intact.
- **codec** - ESAPI encoder/decoder reference implementations.
- **core** - The ESAPI interfaces and reference implementations that are
  not intended to be replaced with enterprise-specific versions are
  called the ESAPI Core.
- **encoder** - Interfaces and implementation classes that perform some
  sort of output encoding, whether as a defense against XSS or to do
  base64 encoding, etc.
- **exception** - ESAPI exception reference implementations.
- **extended factory design pattern** - The "extended" factory design
  pattern refers to the addition of a new security control interface and
  corresponding implementation, which in turn calls ESAPI security
  control reference implementations and/or security control reference
  implementations that were replaced with your own implementations. The
  ESAPI locator class would be called in order to retrieve a singleton
  instance of your new security control, which in turn would call ESAPI
  security control reference implementations and/or security control
  reference implementations that were replaced with your own
  implementations.
- **extended singleton design pattern** - The "extended" singleton
  pattern refers to the replacement of security control reference
  implementations with your own implementations and the
  addition/modification/subtraction of corresponding security control
  interfaces.
- **ES-enable (or ESAPI-enable)** - Just as web applications and web
  services can be Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) enabled (PK-enabled)
  to perform for example certificate-based authentication, applications
  and services can be OWASP ESAPI-enabled (ES-enabled) to enable
  applications and services to protect themselves from attackers.
- **filter** - In ESAPI for Java, there is additionally an HTTP filter
  that can be called separately from the other controls.
- **interfaces** - There is a set of security control interfaces. There
  is no application logic contained in these interfaces. They define for
  example types of parameters that are passed to types of security
  controls. There is no proprietary information or logic contained in
  these interfaces.
- **locator** - The ESAPI security control interfaces include an "ESAPI"
  class that is commonly referred to as a "locator" class. The ESAPI
  locator class is called in order to retrieve singleton instances of
  individual security controls, which are then called in order to
  perform security checks (such as performing an access control check)
  or that result in security effects (such as generating an audit
  record).
- **safe logging** -- ESAPI's attempt to sanitize log output as a
  defense against Log Forging attacks.
- **reference implementation** - There is a reference implementation for
  each security control. There is application logic contained in these
  classes, i.e. contained in these interface implementations. However,
  the logic is not organization-specific and the logic is not
  application-specific. There is no proprietary information or logic
  contained in these reference implementation classes.
- **validator** - An interface or implementation class that does some
  sort of data validation, usually via an accept-list or regular
  expression. ESAPI validators also often handle canonicalization of
  input before the actual data validation is performed.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** - In ESAPI for Java, there is
  additionally a Web Application Firewall (WAF) that can be called
  separately from the other controls.
