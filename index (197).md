## Description

The OWASP Application Security Curriculum project has two initial goals
and those are to provide educational, learning and training materials
for:

- Developers - in how to build secure products in a secure manner; and
- Evaluators - in how to measure security in products (pen testers) and
  in secure software development lifecyles (SSDLC).

The project hopes to do that by building or collecting resources for
learning and by providing training materials (presentations, hands-on
tools, and teaching notes) based on key OWASP projects.

### Awareness - OWASP Top 10

Everything begins with awareness and in application security everything
begins with the [OWASP Top 10](../www-project-top-ten/index.html) and
rightly so. TO that end we have already created the ASC101 (or
Application Security Curriculum Foundational course) and you can grab
the Google Presentation materials
[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EAZgkcBFZ-V-fWLmVP30Iu9z6Tohji5OiwqjY9GOlwo/edit?usp=sharing)
and leverage your OWASP Member benefit with SecureFlag
[here](https://www.secureflag.com/owasp) to work through the hands-on
secure coding exercises.

### Understanding - OWASP Cornucopia

Once development teams are aware of the top issues they might face in
regard to application security they need to develop an understanding of
the ways that they can avoid those pitfalls.

Enter [OWASP Cornucopia](../www-project-cornucopia/index.html)... but
why use Cornucopia? Well, it encourages secure-by-design thinking, for
developers, and because it simplifies issues described in the Top 10,
while making them more generically applicable.

It gives developers tangible abuse cases to consider while planning the
next feature set and can be used to evaluate the system as a whole, or
to focus on getting security non-functional requirements (NFR) sorted
for the next sprint.

Play the game with your development teams and let them play it as often
as they want to. A digital version of the game is available for free
[here](https://copi.securedelivery.io/), provided by one of this
project's sponsors ([Secure Delivery](https://securedelivery.io/))

### Education - OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) / Mobile {#education---owasp-application-security-verification-standard-asvs--mobile}

Now that your teams have an awareness of what they should be building
for security we need to educate them in how they should build to
successfully pass the OWASP standard for application security testing:
The [OWASP
ASVS](../www-project-application-security-verification-standard/index.html).

This is still work in progress, and we are actively looking for
contributors to help us flesh this out. Review the video below if you
are keen to hear about our progress.

On the pen testing side of things there is already a
[Crest](https://www.crest-approved.org/) certification called
[OVS](https://www.crest-approved.org/membership/crest-ovs-programme/)
that pen testers / pen testing companies can achieve that shows they
understand how to test against the standard.

### Ways of Working - OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)

Once developers know how to build a secure thing, they need to
understand how to do so in concert with others. The broader picture of
this is the maturity level of the team performing all the security
aspects of the greater SSDLC - and when we say SSDLC at OWASP, we mean
[OWASP SAMM](../www-project-samm/index.html).

## Getting Involved

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit
foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our
projects ,tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to
anyone interested in improving application security.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our
[Projects](../projects/index.html), [Local
Chapters](../chapters/index.html), [Events](../events/index.html),
[Online
Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/){target="_blank"}, and
[Community Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/){target="_blank"}. We
especially encourage diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is a
fantastic place to learn about application security, to network, and
even to build your reputation as an expert. We also encourage you to be
[become a member](../membership) or consider a
[donation](../donate/index.html) to support our ongoing work.
