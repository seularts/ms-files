The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit
foundation that works to improve the security of software. Our
programming includes:

- Community-led open source projects including code, documentation, and
  standards
- Over 250+ local chapters worldwide
- Tens of thousands of members
- Industry-leading educational and training conferences

We are an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to
conceive, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain applications that can
be trusted. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters
are free and open to anyone interested in improving application
security. The OWASP Foundation launched on December 1st, 2001, becoming
incorporated as a United States non-profit charity on April 21, 2004.

For two decades corporations, foundations, developers, and volunteers
have supported the OWASP Foundation and its work.
