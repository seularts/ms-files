Welcome to the OWASP New Zealand Chapter home page.

The OWASP New Zealand Chapter has been active since 2007. In addition to
supporting and participating in the annual [AppSec New Zealand
Conference](https://appsec.org.nz/conference), we organise local Meetups
and training events throughout the year.

The primary Meetup leaders are [Austin
Chamberlain](https://owasp.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6100141215080f4f0209000c0304130d00080f210e160012114f0e1306)

(Wellington).

### State of AppSec in New Zealand - 2022

In early 2022, a group of volunteers created the inaugural **State of
AppSec in New Zealand Survey**, to gain first-hand information from New
Zealand organisations that develop and/or use software (i.e., all of
them), regarding how they manage, fund, and prioritise the security of
the applications they build and use.

### Call For Speakers

Our Call For Speakers is always open. If you would like to present a
talk relevant to Application Security at a future OWASP New Zealand
Chapter Meetup, review the [speaker
agreement](https://owasp.org/www-policy/speaker-agreement) and send your
proposed talk title, abstract, and a brief speaker bio to the Chapter
Leader(s) in the city(ies) where you'd like to present.

### Call for Organisers

OWASP New Zealand currently has active Meetups in three cities -
Auckland, Hamilton, and Christchurch. If you're interested in helping
organise one of our Meetups, please contact the Chapter Leader in that
city.

If you are located in another New Zealand city (especially Wellington),
and would be willing and able to host a Meetup there (at least four
times per year), then we'd love to hear from you.

### The OWASP New Zealand Board

We are always looking for additional board members to evangelise OWASP
and its mission, and to help with meetings, projects, and initiatives.
As we all know, it takes lots of time and effort to run a chapter.
Please contact us if you are interested in joining the OWASP New Zealand
board, would like to volunteer to help out or create a new Meetup/event,
or for any queries related to the OWASP New Zealand Chapter.

## OWASP Statement on Participation

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) - managed by the
non-profit OWASP Foundation - works to improve the security of software.
All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and
open to anyone interested in improving application security.

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapter
Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/). Financial contributions should
only be made online using the authorised online donation button. To be a
SPEAKER at ANY OWASP Chapter in the world simply review the [speaker
agreement](https://owasp.org/www-policy/) and then contact the local
chapter leader with details of what OWASP Project, independent research,
or related software security topic you would like to present.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our
[Projects](https://owasp.org/projects), [Local
Chapters](https://owasp.org/chapters),
[Events](https://owasp.org/events), [Online
Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/){target="_blank"}, and
[Community Slack Workspace](https://owasp.slack.com/){target="_blank"}.
We especially encourage diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is a
fantastic place to learn about application security, to network, and
even to build your reputation as an expert. We also encourage you to be
[become a member](https://owasp.org/membership) or consider a
[donation](https://owasp.org/donate) to support our ongoing work.

Auth0\
**Location:** Flux Federation Head Office (Level 3/104 Fanshawe Street,
Auckland CBD)\
**Time:** 6:30 p.m.

**Hacking JSON Web Tokens**\
**Abstract:**\
In the world of authentication and authorisation, you might have heard
of JWTs, or JSON Web Tokens, which are used to encapsulate a user's
identity, or convey information to another system that defines
permissions of what can be performed.

They're secure; they're signed; they're the best thing since sliced
bread!

So you've adopted them into your applications and now feel much safer.
The chances things will go wrong are slim. Right?

This talk will introduce some ways JWT implementations can go wrong,
together with live demos, and take you on a journey to understand how to
make sure you can trust these handy payloads in your applications and
APIs.

(YouTube)

From the Juice Shop website: "OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most
modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in
security trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for
security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the entire
OWASP Top Ten along with many other security flaws found in real-world
applications!"

[JuiceShop Project Page](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/)
(OWASP.org)

We hope that you are keeping safe, and that this topic might inspire you
to try out the Juice Shop and search for vulnerabilities.
