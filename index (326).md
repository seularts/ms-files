## Why Become an OWASP Corporate Supporter

Corporate Supporter funds collected directly support OWASP's mission,
helping to fund scholarships, our Projects, Chapters, and more! Funds
provided by Corporate Supporters assist Projects with hiring graphical
designers, user experience experts, contract development, document
writers, and other hourly support personnel, as well as providing
project-related pamphlets, brochures, stickers, and similar
project-identifying material. They contribute to our Chapters, allowing
them to secure venue space for Chapter meetings, promotional material to
help promote the OWASP mission, assist in travel expenses for incoming
speakers/presenters, etc.

Many of our most well-known organizations have grown their business
dramatically by being an OWASP Corporate Supporter and partnering with
us. Our updated Corporate Supporter packages provide you the opportunity
to get involved with the OWASP community.
