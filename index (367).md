## Welcome

Welcome to the OWASP King of Prussia Chapter Homepage! As of July 2024,
we're excited to begin our journey and look forward to hosting regular
meetings in the Philadelphia suburbs. Our aim is to make OWASP events
more accessible to those living outside of Philadelphia. King of
Prussia, conveniently located at the intersection of major highways,
provides an ideal and accessible venue for our events.

## Participation

The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit
foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our
projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to
anyone interested in improving application security.

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapters
Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/chapters). Financial
contributions should only be made online using the authorized online
donation button.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our

[Events](https://owasp.org/events/), [Online
Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/){target="_blank"}, and
[Community Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/){target="_blank"}. We
especially encourage diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is a
fantastic place to learn about application security, to network, and
even to build your reputation as an expert. We also encourage you to be
