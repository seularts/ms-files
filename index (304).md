The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit
foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our
projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to
anyone interested in improving application security.

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapter
policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/). Financial contributions should
only be made online using the authorized online donation button. To be a
SPEAKER at ANY OWASP Chapter in the world simply review the [speaker
agreement](https://owasp.org/www-policy/) and then contact the local
chapter leader with details of what OWASP Project, independent research,
or related software security topic you would like to present.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our
