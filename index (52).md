## Tool mission

Simplify security requirement management during development using
automation approaches.

## Description

The core functionality of SecurityRAT ("**Security** **R**equirement
**A**utomation **T**ool") can be described in the following steps:

1.  You tell SecurityRAT what kind of a software artifact you're going
    to develop / are running
2.  SecurityRAT tells you which requirements you should fulfill.
3.  You decide how you want to handle the desired requirements.
4.  You persist the the artifact state in an issue tracker and create
    tickets for the requirements where an explicit action is necessary
5.  Throughout the continuous development of the particular artifact,
    you respect the rules defined in SecurityRAT and document relevant
    changes in requirement compliance whenever appropriate.

Focus of SecurityRAT is put on automation rather then the requirements.
While we offer ASVS as an initial set of requirements which you can
start with, we strongly recommended to create your own set of
requirements which fits your company risk profile.

## Demo
