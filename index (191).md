## What is ASVS-Graph

ASVS-Graph converts ASVS to a Knowlege-Graph. ASVS already provides
guidance, metrics for Application Security Practicioners.

With ASVS-Graph, Practicioners can

- Automate Verification Process
- Create Knowledge-Graphs - Similar to that of a search engine
- Convert ASVS into a Security Recommender Engine
- Make creation & managemnt of Application Security Metrics simple

## ASVS-Graph v0.0.1 - Expected features {#asvs-graph-v001---expected-features}

- Automated Graph Seeding process
- Knowledge Graphs - Create knowledge graphs
- Convert the Knowledge Graphs to Recommender Engine
- Click-to-deploy `self-serve`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}
  instructions

## Data Relationship - Architecture

- ASVS Requirements under Architecuture have a deeper relationships that
  are simply waiting to be explored.
- Below is a minified JSON view of ASVS Requirements with the following
  (Apologies for renaming columns in ASVS Graph - Consistency will be
  brought in soon).
  1.  `serial`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge} represents column
      `item`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge} from ASVS.
  2.  `description`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}represents
      coulumn `Description`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge} from
      ASVS.
  3.  `stage`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge} represents column
      `Name`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge} from ASVS.
- With ASVS-Graph, we make this view to be more fruitful by tying a
  strong relationship based on any attribute deemed fit.
  1.  Helping us derive a relationship that
      `Architecture requirements`{.language-plaintext
      .highlighter-rouge} flow downwards to other
      `verification stages`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}.
  2.  Paint us a broader picture that there is deeper relationship
      between different `verification stages`{.language-plaintext
      .highlighter-rouge}.
  3.  Convert **Hunches** to more tangible requirements.
