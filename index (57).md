## Purpose of Security Bridge:

"Security Bridge" aims to build bridges in our community to go beyond
the technical aspects of application security and start talking and
learning about the daily challenges we face that impact our success and
wellbeing.

- "Resource Hub": provides markdown files in the Github repo, offering
  training resources for employees to easily access and share with their
  peers and teams. The focus is to raise awareness and equip
  professionals in the Application Security industry (and beyond) with
  knowledge, tools and guidance to help prevent burnout and build
  greater resilience; essential to overall mental health & wellbeing.

- "Online community space": by using Github Discussions, industry
  professionals have a forum to share their thoughts and experiences
  across 3 main areas around wellbeing and resilience:

1.  What are some things you do that help you in a stressful situation?
2.  Share some of the things you do that support your mental health &
    wellbeing.
3.  What do you do to wind down at the end of your day?

Sharing stories will help build awareness and resilience individually as
well as a community.

The main goal is: "Connecting Cyber Security Professionals to nurture a
resilient cyber security community."

There are 4 areas that should be covered by this project:

1.  Understand & Identify Stress (Mental Overwhelm) & Burnout.
2.  Mental (Mind) Tactics, Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) for Managing
    Burnout, Navigating Stress and Building Resilience.
3.  Physiological (Body) Tactics, Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) for
    Managing Burnout, Navigating Stress and Building Resilience.
4.  Online Community Space for resources and sharing.

TTPs are being used in this project in a similar fashion as the MITRE
ATT&CK to help cyber security professionals relate to have an execution
path that they can apply to their daily lives.

## Project roadmap

After approval of the project the Github Discussion is being started
with the topics mentioned above.

We will populate background information to the project to raise
awareness and build the TTPs gradually.

This project is a collaboration between Tuyen Do and Sven Schleier.
