On behalf of the [OWASP ASVS](../../../../asvs.html) leadership team, we
are excited to publicise the objectives and roadmap for the upcoming
version 5.0 of the flagship OWASP Application Security Project. We are
hoping to be able to release a final version by the end of the year but
there is a lot to do and we need **your** help!

Our first milestone is the **end of May** by when we would like to have
as much feedback as possible on the current standard so as to start
planning how the next version will look.

You may wish to read through [the full objectives and roadmap
document](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/wiki/Roadmap-to-version-5.0) (or
keep reading this post), review the [current "bleeding edge"
version](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/tree/master/5.0/en) of the ASVS
document, and check out our [guide to
contributing](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
which also includes guidance of the process to go through to provide
feedback.

Whilst following that guidance, you are then welcome to respond to
[existing issues](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/issues) or [open a new
issue](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=standard-asvs-issue.md&title=)
if your topic has not previously been raised.

## Background

As the primary application security standard in the industry, it is
important that the ASVS does not change too often to make it easier to
standardize against and monitor.

On the other hand, with version 4 released back in 2019 we believe that
it is time for an update to take into account more recent developments
and act on feedback we have received. As such, it is our intention to
release a new version around the end of this calendar year.

## Plotting a course

In order to be able to release a new major version, obviously we need to
plan ahead so that we have enough time to gather feedback, enough time
to discuss the feedback, and enough time to write the new version and
get feedback on a draft.

For this reason, we are hoping to get as much feedback as possible on
the current ASVS version within the next few weeks, via our GitHub
repository.

That should allow us to discuss and conclude on the feedback during June
and July, prepare a new draft version during August through to October
(we too have to take holidays ðŸ˜ƒ), discuss the draft in November, and
finalise the release in December.

## Vision for version 5.0 {#vision-for-version-50}

At this point, we don't necessarily want a complete "from the ground up"
rewrite. Our main goal is to take the existing standard and update it
with the latest guidance but our guiding star for the release will be
usability.

### Barrier to entry

We are seeing plenty of interest and engagement around the ASVS but it
still has a relatively high barrier to entry, with just level 1 having
around 130 requirements. Our aim is to make it easier to start with the
standard, without lowering its integrity or making it less
comprehensive.

For example, we would rather reduce the number of requirements needed to
get to the first level if it means that more organizations can get to
that starting level. In time, this will lead them to attempt higher
levels as well.

### Clarity in the standard

We want to make sure that all requirements are as easily understandable
as possible so that users with varying levels of knowledge are able to
use the status effectively.

We'll also be taking a critical look at the text surrounding the
requirements. There is a lot of explanatory text within the standard
which is helpful to better understand the requirements and application
security in general. However, it is not clear how many people are really
using this. From what we have seen, the main value comes from the
requirements themselves and it is likely that we will try and streamline
the overall document to keep the requirements front and centre.

### Mappings

There are a lot of requests for mappings and various mapping currently
being maintained. Our aim is only to maintain the CWE and NIST mappings
with other mappings being maintained by the community on a best efforts
basis. This is to allow us to focus on the requirements themselves.

Similarly, our aim is to move mappings to a separate location within the
repository/document to reduce the noise on the page of the standard and
again make sure that we are keeping the requirements front and center.

## Summary

We are very grateful to everyone who has spent time providing feedback
and contributions to the standard and we hope that you will continue to
do so over the coming months. The ASVS is a crucial standard for helping
organizations to build secure applications and we are excited to
continue its development.
