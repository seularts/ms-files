Welcome to OWASP Memphis!! What is OWASP Memphis? Well... we don't
really know yet! I'm assuming you already know what OWASP is if you've
gotten here; several local infosec professionals decided we need to be
proactive in organizing so we started [MEMSEC](https://memsec.info/),
which has included DC901 and Memphis2600, and so we figured we should
include OWASP as well.

We have been meeting every first Friday of the month at the University
of Memphis in the [FedEx Institute of Technology
(FIT)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=365+Innovation+Dr%2C+Memphis%2C+TN+38152)
building, room 225

## Participation

The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit
foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our
projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to
anyone interested in improving application security.

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapters
Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/chapters). Financial
contributions should only be made online using the authorized online
donation button.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our
[Projects](https://owasp.org/projects/), [Local
Chapters](https://owasp.org/chapters/),
[Events](https://owasp.org/events/), [Online
Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/), and [Community Slack
Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/). We especially encourage diversity in
all our initiatives. OWASP is a fantastic place to learn about
application security, to network, and even to build your reputation as
an expert. We also encourage you to be [become a
member](https://owasp.org/membership/) or consider a
[donation](https://owasp.org/donate/) to support our ongoing work.
