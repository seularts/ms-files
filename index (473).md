## Welcome

The OWASP Belfast chapter was founded in 2014 by Gary Robinson and
Michelle Simpson. We have hosted a large number of fantastic events and
also hosted AppSec EU 2017 in the Belfast Waterfront attracting over 750
delegates from all over the world. What is OWASP Belfast? OWASP Belfast
is just one of over 100 OWASP Chapters around the world, including 4 in
Ireland and 12 in the UK, where people meet to learn about and discuss
software security topics. The OWASP organization also has lots of active
projects that volunteers can participate in to create code and documents
for the worldwide security community. The OWASP Top 10 project is the
most famous of those projects.

Who is OWASP Belfast for? It's for programmers, testers, students,
project managers, development managers and security experts to
collaborate and drive discussion on application security topics.
Participation in the mailing lists and attendance at the OWASP Belfast
sessions are free, in fact many of the events will provide food and
drinks to attendees.

Why be part of OWASP Belfast? The community organizes sessions where
experts from across the industry (and globe) give presentations and
seminars about application security topics. Attendance and participation
in the community increases knowledge and skills, allowing people to
stand out from the crowd. Opportunity to network with other Software
Professionals and keep in touch with job opportunities in the region.
