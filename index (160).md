Welcome to the Data Analysis, Visualization, and Ingestion Domain or the
DAVID Project. DAVID's purpose is to enable open source projects to tell
their ongoing stories with data.

DAVID should provide:

- Data Consistency and Integrity: A centralized system ensures that data
  across all projects follows the same data governance standards, thus
  increasing data integrity and consistency.
- Simplified Data Management: A centralized system streamlines data
  management processes, reducing the burden of each OWASP project
  managing data individually. Lessons learned from each project can be
  applied to future projects when they are on-boarded and consistency
  can be ensured.
- Time and Cost Savings: A centralized system reduces the time spent on
  data management and maintenance, resulting in cost savings across
  projects. Consolidating data in one location minimizes redundancy and
  promotes quicker data retrieval, improving the overall efficiency of
  OWASP projects.
- Better Decision-Making: Access to comprehensive and consistent data
  enables data-driven decision-making, leading to more accurate and
  effective outcomes for OWASP projects and organizations that rely on
  them.
- Scalability: A centralized data management system can easily
  accommodate new projects, ensuring seamless integration and
  scalability.
- Compliance and Auditing: A centralized system simplifies compliance
  and auditing processes by providing a unified platform to track and
  monitor data access and usage.
- Enhanced Data Visibility: A centralized system improves data
  visibility, making it easier to identify trends, patterns, and
  insights that can drive innovation and improvement in OWASP projects.

OWASP SAMM Benchmarking is an ideal pilot project to implement the
centralized data management system as it deals with the collection,
analysis, and reporting of maturity data for various organizations.
Implementing the centralized system will streamline data management
processes, improve data quality, and facilitate more effective
benchmarking results for organizations. The successful implementation of
this system will serve as a strong foundation for future OWASP projects,
driving innovation and impact in the application security community.

If you would like to help sponsor the project or are an open source
project with data needs, please contact the project leads.

## Call for DAVID Sponsors

The Data Analysis, Visualization, and Ingestion Domain (DAVID) Project
is the open source software data management project for OWASP and open
source projects.

We are seeking sponsors to support the DAVID project. All proceeds from
the sponsorship support the mission of the OWASP Foundation, further
development of DAVID, and operating costs. Supporting the project drives
the funding for research grants, hosting, tools, templates, documents,
promotion, and more.

By sponsoring DAVID, you not only support an important project, you will
also get visibility during the next SAMM User Conference and recognition
on the OWASP SAMM [web site](https://owaspsamm.org/) and the next
releases of SAMM.
