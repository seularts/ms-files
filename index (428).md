Dorset Chapter Leads)

##### Mike Warner

Deepfakes; an emergent type of threat falling under the greater and more
pervasive umbrella of synthetic media, utilise a form of Artificial
Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) to create believable, realistic
videos, pictures, audio, and text of events which never happened.

Criminals are already starting to utilise deepfake technology to
impersonate executives' voices on phone calls and even their likenesses
over video to add an air of legitimacy to their attacks. As deepfakes
become more lifelike, phone calls, video chats and other forms of
communication will be more vulnerable to abuse.

This talk with look at the origins of Deepfake technology, how they
work, the threats and ethical quandaries they pose, and potential
mitigations, with a handful of
demos.([PDF](assets/presentations/2022-10/OWASP_Deepfakes-A_Growing_Cybersecurity_Concern.pdf "wikilink"))([VIDEO](https://youtu.be/PAegKvRSjoc?t=347))

##### Nikki Webb

--- [Respect In Security](https://respectinsecurity.org/), three very
simple yet important words, it may sound like a fairly obvious statement
but sadly it is not, according to our research, more than a third of
Infosec professionals have experienced harassment or abuse from their
peers. The other founders of Respect in Security and I, have taken a
stand to help encourage more positive and inclusive behaviour and to
help support those victims of harassment. I will be telling you all a
little more about how we are planning on doing just that.
([VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpoRwKr-vds&t=1165s))\
If you have been a victim of online harassment you can contact [The
Cyber Helpline](https://www.thecyberhelpline.com/) for immediate advice.
If you are a victim of cyber crime you are advised to report the crime
immediately to [Action
Fraud](http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/report_fraud) or in Scotland to
[Police
Scotland](http://www.scotland.police.uk/contact-us/report-cybercrime)

their identity, their attributes and most importantly of all, what you
can do to stop them.

--- I Know What You Did Last Summer: New persistent tracking mechanisms
used in the wild Web Storage, Indexed Database API and Web SQL Database
allow web browsers to store information in the client in a much more
advanced way compared to other techniques, such as HTTP Cookies. They
were originally introduced with the goal of enhancing the capabilities
of websites, however, they are often exploited as a way of tracking
users across multiple sessions and websites. The presentation will be
divided into two parts. First, it will quantify the usage of these three
primitives in the context of user tracking. This is done by performing a
large-scale analysis on the usage of these techniques in the wild. The
second part reviews the effectiveness of the removal of client-side
storage data in modern
browsers.([PDF](assets/presentations/2019-01/OWASP_Dorset_Chapter_Meeting_Jan_2019_Talk_2_Web_Tracking.pdf "wikilink")\])

# Businesses

Becoming a supporter of OWASP Dorset is a great way to gain brand
recognition, demonstrate to customers and staff that you are serious
about security, attract talent and boost your local community.

There are many ways you can help:

**Donate space -** Donate some of your work space, breakout areas or
other space to an OWASP Dorset event. We will add your logo to the Event
Sponsor section of our main webpage and thank you at the event, you are
also welcome to operate a small booth at the event (subject to
conditions)

**Event Sponsor -** Our event sponsors provide a specific one off
[donation](../donate/index8492.html?reponame=owasp.github.io) for an
individual event which will be used to supply that event with
refreshments with any remaining funds going towards covering travel
costs of speakers where appropriate and similar expenses. We will add
your logo to the Event Sponsor section of our main webpage (for at least
1 year) and thank you at the event, you are also welcome to operate a
small booth at the event (subject to conditions)

**Chapter Sponsorship -** You can sponsor the Dorset Chapter and it's
activities in general by becoming a Chapter Sponsor either with a one
off donation or regularly for a year or more. Your donation will help us
to fund events, specifically; "Event Services, Catering, and Space for
Chapter Meetings". And in exceptional, Guest Speaker, cases travel
expenses dependent on approval from the [OWASP Executive
Director](../www-policy/operational/expense-reimbursement-2.html). As a
chapter sponsor we will place your logo on our main chapter page under
the Chapter Sponsor heading (for the duration of your sponsorship) and
thank your company at our events. You will also be able to send
representatives to attend the events and operate a booth at events
(subject to conditions).

**Speaker --** Encourage your staff to give a talk at one of our
meetups, it's amazing what businesses in Dorset are doing and how they
are helping to protect against cyber threats, there is a huge amount of
work being done in Dorset and sharing your knowledge helps to make us
all more secure.

\*Please be assured that the leaders of OWASP Dorset are volunteers who
are not paid for their time or personal expenses. Speakers are also
volunteers who are only reimbursed for expenses directly related to the
event they are participating in, should they request it, but in most
cases our speakers generously cover their own costs. You can read
OWASP's expense policy
[here](../www-policy/operational/expense-reimbursement-2.html) and
review OWASP's finances [here](../finance/index.html). As a chapter we
can receive up to 90% of your donation with 10% going directly to OWASP
Global.
