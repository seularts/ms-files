## What is the OWASP Application Gateway?

OWASP Application Gateway is an HTTP reverse proxy that sits between
your web application and the client and handles Oauth2 login, session
management as well as other security aspects and operational
requirements (including for example correlation logging / tracing). For
you, as a developer, OWASP Application Gateway removes the hassle to
implement complicated oauth2 logic in the backend and frontend so you
can focus totally on your applications logic. OAG is built in an
extendable way, so that it is easy to customize it with your own code
when required.
