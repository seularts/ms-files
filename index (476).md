# About OWASP Bay Area Chapter

## Geographic Area of Bay Area Chapter

The 'Bay Area' is actually the San Francisco Bay Area in California,
which is near other large towns that are across the bay from San
Francisco such as Berkeley and Oakland, and south of San Francisco are
San Mateo, Palo Alto, and the whole San Jose area. Currently, the Bay
Area OWASP Chapter covers this whole geographic region.

### Notes about OWASP presentations

OWASP presentations are geared for a technical audience. We are
particularly interested in new approaches to tackling application
security problems, defensive techniques for new technology in the
application security space and lessons learned from developers and
security professionals tackling application security. Please consider a
wide breadth of topic areas and we can discuss if they should be
tailored in a particular direction for the OWASP audience.

OWASP chapter presentations must not be sales pitches and must adhere to
a vendor neutral approach to the topic.

## Chapter Meetings

[OWASP Bay Area Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-OWASP/) - All
events can be found here

### About Presentation Events

Presentation events will feature 1 or more speakers discussing
application security. These events will include a networking session,
with drinks and food, before and after the event.

### About OWASP Social Hours

The purpose of the OWASP social gathering is:

- Informal security chat - the benefits of "hallway con" and security
  talk with others in the industry
- Networking - meet other people in the field and industry
- After work drinks - a nice break after a long work day

Note: These events won't have any formal presentations. They're meant to
be social gatherings to meet others in the industry and chat about
security. Check our quarterly OWASP Bay Area schedule for the security
presentation events. <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Bay_Area>

    want to learn more about securing their code as well as security
    professionals who want to become acquainted with the latest web
    vulnerabilities.
  - Presented by Jim Manico and Eoin Keary, this intensive boot camp
    focuses on the most common web application security problems,
    including aspects of both the OWASP Top Ten and the MITRE Top
    1.  The course will introduce and demonstrate application assessment
        techniques, illustrating how application vulnerabilities can be
        exploited so students really understand how to avoid introducing
        such vulnerabilities in their code and understand fixes.
