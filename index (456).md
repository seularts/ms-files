## Welcome

The OWASP Buea Chapter was established in 2024 with the aim of promoting
secure software development practices in the local tech community. We
focus on application security, sharing best practices, and fostering
collaboration to build a diverse and vibrant security community in the
region. Additionally, we actively work to build a diverse and inclusive
security community by organizing workshops, meetups, and hackathons
targeted at different experience levels.

## Participation

The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit
foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our
projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to
anyone interested in improving application security.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our
[Projects](../projects/index.html), [Local
Chapters](../chapters/index.html), [Events](../events/index.html),
[Online
Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/){target="_blank"}, and
[Community Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/){target="_blank"}. We
especially encourage diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is a
fantastic place to learn about application security, to network, and
even to build your reputation as an expert.

**Group: [Buea](index.html)**

**Time: 21:00 (WAT)**

**Description:** We're excited to kick off OWASP Buea Chapter meetups
for 2025! This will be our first session of the year, and we're inviting
developers, security professionals, students, and tech enthusiasts to
join us for a practical and insightful virtual meetup. This session will
focus on the growing importance of web and mobile application security.
As more financial services and everyday tools move online especially in
the banking and fintech space understanding how to secure these
applications is no longer optional. We'll explore real-world security
issues and how attackers exploit them, using a deliberately vulnerable
banking application developed by Al-Amir Badmus. We'll also take some
time to reintroduce the OWASP Buea Chapter, meet the chapter leaders,
and talk about what's planned for the rest of the year.

Agenda

Welcome & Chapter Vision for 2025 Meet the three OWASP Buea Chapter
leaders and get a quick overview of the chapter's mission, what we stand
for, and the kind of activities we're planning this year. What is OWASP?
A short introduction for those new to the community. What OWASP does
globally, why it matters, and how you can get involved locally and
remotely. Demo Session -- Exploring OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities Using a
real-world inspired, intentionally vulnerable banking app, we'll walk
through several common issues from the OWASP Top 10. Expect to see
practical examples of: Insecure APIs Broken access controls Injection
vulnerabilities And more

We'll also look at how to detect these issues and discuss best practices
for building more secure apps especially in environments where mobile
and API-based architectures are the norm. Why attend? Get hands-on
exposure to real security issues developers and testers face today
Understand how OWASP tools and projects can support your learning or
organization Meet like-minded professionals and grow your network in the
security space Learn how to contribute to the chapter or OWASP projects

Please RSVP and spread the word We're building a strong security
community in Buea and beyond. Whether you're here to learn, contribute,
or just stay updated this meetup is for you. Invite a friend. Share on
social media. Let's grow together.
