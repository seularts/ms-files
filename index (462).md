## Welcome

Welcome to the OWASP Bonita Springs chapter. This chapter intends to

providing relevant discussion on privacy and compliance issues.

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapter
Policy](../www-policy/index.html). Financial contributions should only
be made online using the authorized online donation button. To be a
SPEAKER at ANY OWASP Chapter in the world simply review the [speaker
