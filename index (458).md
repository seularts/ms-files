## Welcome

Welcome to the Brisbane chapter homepage!

We've been a bit quiet during the COVID19 crisis, but we're up and
running again!

#### OWASP Brisbane is proudly celebrating OWASP's 20th Anniversary!

## Local News

#### Presenters and Presentations

We are forever looking for volunteers to present at the chapter
meetings, so if you've seen something interesting or you have something
to say, please let us know.

Often, when we approach potential presenters, we tend to get the
following response -- "I don't think my topic is interesting enough". We
just want to stress that as long as the topic is security related --
we're all ears! We're just a bunch of nice people wanting to learn/share
our knowledge of the security domain. So if you would like to present or
know of someone that does, please contact us.

Presentations must be vendor agnostic (no selling of products or
services), and please review the Speaker Agreement and information
below.

## Participation

The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit
foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our
projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to
anyone interested in improving application security.

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapter
Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/). Financial contributions should
only be made online using the authorized online donation button. To be a
SPEAKER at ANY OWASP Chapter in the world simply review the [speaker
agreement](https://owasp.org/www-policy/) and then contact the local
chapter leader with details of what OWASP Project, independent research,
or related software security topic you would like to present.

## Chapter Meetings

Details of OWASP Brisbane chapter meetings will be posted on our [meetup
page](https://www.meetup.com/brisbane-owasp-meetup-group/events/).
