governance and leadership roles. Meetings follow the [Typical Board
Meeting Agenda](typical_agenda.html) and are recorded.

The OWASP Foundation Global Board is comprised of seven elected members
who serve for two-year terms. The Call for Global Board nominations
occurs in June through August each year, after which OWASP members vote
to elect vacancies from qualified nominees during October. Generally our
Board meets monthly and meetings are open to the public.

Board members are the fiduciaries who steer the organization towards a
sustainable future by adopting sound, ethical, and legal governance and
financial management policies, as well as by making sure the nonprofit
has adequate resources to advance its mission.

Responsibilities](https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/tools-resources/board-roles-and-responsibilities))

Vandana Verma seconds\
Budgeted or Discretionary per transaction (or related transactions),
grant making, awards and scholarships, expense approvals, legally
binding contractual arrangements, and purchasing assets:

\$0 - \$10,000 Executive Director can sign and approve without second
approver

\$10,000 to \$250,000 Executive Director and Treasurer or Chair can sign
and approve without Board approval

\$250,000 or more requires an affirmative Board vote

Signing authority:

Transferring funds between and managing OWASP bank accounts and other
financial accounts \$ 250,000

Budgeted General Operational Spending (including but not limited to,
payroll, expenses, and accounts payable), \$ 500,000

The intent is that any unplanned discretionary approvals still remains
within 10% of the quarterly plan, so if we have a quarterly plan of
\$250k, the ED will continue to have a discretionary power to spend up
to \$25k per quarter before requiring Board approval to continue with
unplanned expenses. We have used that recently for legal fees.. [\

Subsidiary motion: Amend the Director's Code of Conduct to address
harassment and repeated violations. Background The Director's Code of
Conduct did not have anti-harassment provisions, and the consequences of
repeated violations with Delaware law was not legal. This addition and
amendment to the Director's Code of Conduct resolve both issues.
Resolved, that the Foundation is directed to amend the Board of
Directors Code of Conduct to include or change the following clauses:

**Anti-Harassment**

Board members must not engage in any intimidating, harassment,
discriminatory, abusive, derogatory, or demeaning speech or actions
("harassment" includes, but is not limited to: communication or conduct
that a reasonable person in the individual's circumstances would
consider unwelcome, intimidating, hostile, threatening, violent, abusive
or offensive, such communication may be related to gender, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, national
origin, race, age, religion; it also includes stalking, following,
harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or
other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
attention), and replace the following text

**Sanctions**

Board Members Behavior and Conduct - Board Members who intentionally and
repeatedly do not follow proper conduct, may be reprimanded or formally
censured by the Board. Repeated violations of the Board Code of Conduct,
the Board can take the step of recommending the removal of a Director
under Bylaw Section 2.04. Sherif Mansour motions, Grant Ongers seconds.

Resolved, the Board directs the Foundation to update OWASP's bylaws as
per the following text within 30 days to become compliant with the
Delaware General Corporate Law. Sherif Mansour motions, Grant Ongers
seconds

**Section 2.04**

Directors may be removed from office by the members, with or without
cause, as permitted by and in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware. The Board will recommend to the Members that a Director be
removed from office when there is a finding that a Director has
committed an action that results in a finding of \'Cause.\' A
determination of \'Cause\' by the Board of Directors requires an
affirmative vote of the full number of voting Directors then in office,
except for the Director being considered for removal. For the purpose of
these Bylaws, the term "Cause" shall mean (w) repeated violations of the
Board Code of Conduct Policy or (x) a final conviction of a felony
involving moral turpitude or (y) willful misconduct that is materially
and demonstrably injurious to OWASP or (z) a no-confidence vote by the
Board of Directors under Section 3.04 of the Bylaws. For purposes of the
definition of \'Cause,\' no act, or failure to act, by a Director shall
be considered \'willful\' unless committed in bad faith and without a
reasonable belief that the act or failure to act was in the best
interest of OWASP. As voting by OWASP Members is optional, a simple
majority of votes received by members in good standing shall govern if
the Director is removed.

**Section 3.03 Regular meetings**

The Board of Directors shall have regular meetings as needed. A link to
the board meeting agenda's and the historical minutes is here:
https://owasp.org/www-board/. Meetings shall be at such dates, times,
and places as the Board shall determine in December of the preceding
year and as amended by the Board. In no event will there be less than
one meeting per quarter. These meetings will be open to public
attendance. However, certain portions of the meeting may be closed to
board members and their delegates when required for legal reasons, or to
shield liability, or to handle personnel issues, or similar. Attendance
in person or virtually by board members is required at no less than 75%
of the total meetings each year and shall be highly encouraged to meet
in person at least once annually at a date to be announced and agreed
upon. To be considered as "attended," the board member must attend at
least 90% of the meeting, starting at the published scheduled time until
the published end time or the meeting is adjourned (whichever is
earlier). Attendance is tabulated by the Executive Director or delegate
within seven days after every scheduled meeting for the purpose of
determining if the 75% attendance requirement has been met, and the
tabulation is based upon the entire calendar year. Canceled meetings are
considered attended for the purposes of the tabulation. Failure by a
board member to meet the 75% attendance requirement after any tabulation
will cause a mandatory vote of confidence by the remaining board
members, whose votes will be publicly recorded. The vote of confidence
is to take place within 21 days, but no sooner than seven days, of
notification by the Executive Director or delegate that a board member
has not met the attendance threshold. During the first seven days, the
board member in question will have an opportunity to make their case to
their fellow board members. The vote of confidence will take place on
the OWASP Board of Directors email list unless the Board votes to review
the matter at their next meeting, so long as the next meeting occurs
within the 21­day window. An overall vote of "no confidence" is recorded
if more than half of the board members vote for it, which causes the
board member in question to be instantly removed from their seat on the
Board. If a vote of confidence does not pass, the Board will put a vote
of removal and recommend to the members to remove the Director, per
section 2.04. [\

to adopt 2/3rd majority for Director and Officer remova, Sherif Mansour
motions, Owen Pendlebury seconds\
\
\*\*Note on 2/3rd vote\*\*. Robert\'s Rules of Order gives extensive
guidance on what two thirds formally means, along with numeric examples
in section RONR (12 ed) 44:3, and means:\
\
\* A two thirds vote - when the term is unqualified - means at least two
thirds of the votes cast by persons entitled to vote, excluding blanks
and abstentions, at a regular or properly called meeting. For example
(assuming that there are no fractions of votes):\*\
\* \*If 30 votes are cast, a two thirds vote is 20\*\
\* \*If 31 votes are cast, a two thirds vote is 21\*\
\* \*If 32 votes are cast, a two thirds vote is 22\*\
\* \*If 33 votes are cast, a two thirds vote is 22\*\
\
Based upon recusal = abstention, a board of 7, a two thirds vote would
be as follows:\
\
\* If 5 votes are cast, a two thirds vote is 4 votes\
\* If 6 votes are cast, a two thirds vote is 4 votes\
\* If 7 votes are case, a two thirds vote is 5 votes\
\*\*Background:\*\* Our lawyers reviewed our bylaws, and noted that our
simple majority vote is not the industry standard and is too low a bar
for significant organizational change. They recommend the adoption of a
notice period and 2/3rd majority of the Board for changes to OWASP
bylaws and policy changes. Their advice agrees with Robert\'s Rules of
Order, Newly Revised (12th ed.) section 57, which is used to draft the
motion below:\

It is resolved that to promote the creation of additional core
committees to enumerate the powers devolved to Committees, with
appropriate checks and balances to comply with legal, tax and other
regulations and safeguards to protect the Foundation and Board, that the
following Committee policy is approved. Existing Committees will
transition to the governance model of this Committee policy. OWASP's
bylaws should be amended to allow the devolution of certain Board
responsibilities and activities to committees as follows:\
\
Change from\
\
SECTION 5.01 Committees\
Establishment. The Board of Directors may, by resolution adopted by a
majority of the Directors in office, establish one or more Advisory
Boards or Committees. Committees will be held to the core purpose and
core values as outlined in Sections 1.02 and 1.03. Committees will be
structured according to the guidelines in Policy and Procedure.\`\`\`\
\
to\
\
SECTION 5.01 Committees\
Establishment. The Board of Directors may, by resolution adopted by a
majority of the Directors in office, establish one or more Board
sub-committees (e.g, fundraising, finance, audit, or executive),
Advisory Boards, or Committees. These will be held to the core purpose
and core values as outlined in Sections 1.02 and 1.03. Committees are
formed and governed by the Committees Policy, and are limited the
Charter\'s purpose and scope. As a Committee Charter might devolve
powers currently held by the Board or the Foundation to the Committee,
any such devolution to a Committee will require a 2/3rd majority
vote.\`\`\`\

Resolved, the Board directs the Foundation to provide automated
complimentary Membership to the top 5 active leaders of chapters,
projects, events, and committees, effective November 1st, 2020, and
monthly after that. Honorary Membership will become an award made by the
Board, and changed to be for five years in recognition of extraordinary
service to the OWASP Community. Regional pricing will be made available
to all classes of paid Membership.\
The following bylaw amendment is required to support this change in
membership model:\
SECTION 4.01 Membership Classes\
There shall be the following classes of OWASP members: Corporate,
Individual, Complimentary, Honorary, and Student.\
SECTION 4.02 Qualifications\
Individual, Corporate, and Student Membership may be granted to any
individual or organization that supports the Foundation\'s mission and
purpose, is in good standing subject to our Code of Ethics, and pays the
dues as set by the Board of Directors. The Foundation may, at its
discretion, offer monthly, annual, two-year, and Lifetime memberships.
Regional pricing is available to all paid membership classes.\
Complimentary Membership may be offered on an opt-in and automated basis
to the top 5 active leaders of any chapter, project, event, or committee
that supports the Foundation\'s mission and purpose, is in good standing
subject to our Code of Ethics, and has been in the top 5 position
continuously for six months prior to applying for complimentary
membership. Complimentary Membership is valid for one year. Leaders do
not need to accept any offer of complementary leadership. Complementary
members in good standing for 12 months may stand for the Board, but if
elected, must maintain good standing with paid Membership. Directors who
are eligible through the above criteria must not accept Complimentary
Membership during their term and maintain good standing with paid
Membership.\
Honorary Membership is equivalent to Individual Membership and valid for
five years. Honorary Membership shall be determined and approved solely
by a majority vote of the Board of Directors for long-standing and
extraordinary services to the OWASP Community.\
All membership classes are eligible to vote in elections. Sherif Mansour
motions, Owen Pendlebury seconds\

2020-10-20\
Resolved, that the Foundation shall draw up a policy to operationalize
rapid, escalating, and time limited responses to continued breaches of
the OWASP Code of Conduct by participants and members. If the behavior
is continuous, unlawful, or egregious, the policy should refer to and
rely upon the existing bylaw governing the Board\'s power to revoke
membership.\
The following should be added to the Code of Conduct policy to enable
sanctions:\
Sanctions\
The Executive Director can suspend participation in OWASP for 30 days
for perceived or actual breaches of the OWASP Code of Conduct or US law.
Depending on the severity of the breach, the member or participant can
accept the 30-day suspension, or in serious cases, the member or
participant will be referred to the Compliance Committee for a decision
regarding their ongoing participation or membership by the OWASP Board
at the next available Board meeting.\
For first time Code of Conduct breaches where no violation of US law has
occurred: The member or participant can agree to comply with a temporary
suspension imposed by the Executive Director of all OWASP participation
for no more than 30 days. Membership will not be extended to cover the
suspension.\
For repeat or serious breaches of the Code of Conduct, or where a
participant has been charged with a crime, the Executive Director must
suspend the member, refer the matter to the Compliance Committee, who
will make an independent evaluation on if the Board should strip
leadership, revoke participation, or membership privileges. The period
of suspension will remain in place until after the Board votes on the
matter.\
If the Board decides to take no action, full participation can resume
immediately. If the participant is a member, their membership will be
extended by the period of the suspension served.\
Transparency and Oversight\
To provide transparency and oversight of sanctions, the Executive
Director will inform the Board privately of the actions being taken
under these sanctions, informing the Compliance Committee as required,
and providing recommendations from the Compliance Committee to the Board
and scheduling a vote as necessary. Grant Ongers motions, Richard
Greenberg seconds\

that Directors that exit their term prematurely have served a two-year
term for the purposes of term limits, and Directors that serve a partial
term to fill a vacancy have not served a two-year term for the purposes
of term limits. This motion will take effect November 1, 2020.\
This motion replaces section 2.05 and 3.10 with the following text. The
italic text is new.\
\
SECTION 2.05 Vacancies\
A vacancy in any office because of death, resignation, removal,
disqualification or otherwise, may be filled by the Board of Directors
for the unexpired portion of the term.\
If a Director creates a Vacancy, such as being removed or resigned, the
entire term is considered served for that Member for the purposes of
term limits.\
\
SECTION 3.10 Vacancies\
Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors may be filled by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors though less
than a quorum of the Board of Directors unless otherwise provided by
law. If there is an equal number of affirmative and negative votes then
the ultimate determination shall be made by the then­ sitting Chairman of
the Board. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the
unexpired term of his predecessor in office. Any directorship to be
filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled
by election by the Board of Directors for a term of office continuing
only until the next election of directors by the Directors.\
Appointed Directors filling a vacancy shall not have this partial term
counted against term limits.\
\
Subsidiary Motion: It is resolved to amend the vacancy appointment
bylaws in section 3.10 to prevent multiple appointments to get around
term limits, by adding to the end of the main amendment the following
text:\
Members can only be appointed to fill a vacancy once every ten years to
prevent bypassing term limits: to section 3.10. Grant Ongers motions,

E-Vote (1): It is resolved that any member whose membership lapsed due
to issues with the membership management system, but who otherwise
fulfils the requirements to stand for the Board, should be granted
exemption from the \'paid\' component of the \'in good standing\' clause
for eligibility so long as they can show evidence of having made a
reasonable attempt to maintain continuous membership. Evidence of having
made a reasonable attempt to maintain continuous membership would
involve: an email trail between the member and the Foundation\'s staff
showing an honest attempt to pay for one\'s membership through
acceptable means; evidence of a failed transaction to the OWASP account;
or evidence of a credit to a member\'s membership belatedly applied by
the Foundation. Should there be any doubt as the validity of the claim a
majority vote of the Board will decide the outcome on a case-by-case
basis.\

from specific types of reimbursements and payables. However, the intent
of the change (streamlining payments) was blocked by the need for board
members (Chairman or Treasurer) to \'release\' the funds from the US
bank account. The proposed modification would allow for the release of
funds from the US bank for any of the specific reimbursement categories
below. As we are currently doing, the details of all payables will be
sent to the board during the bi-monthly payment batches so the board is
apprised of all payables regardless of the categories below.. [Passes:

Allow the organisers of the Summit to spend up to \$50k USD using funds
allocated from the original \$150k seed allocation to fund OWASP staff
attendance and other activities as set set out in emails to the Board
and in the Summit Budget. 2. Cost to OWASP - up to \$50k USD. Organisers
will continue to work with OWASP staff to ensure that sponsorships and
income is booked through the Foundation, as the event will likely make a
loss. The Board requests the Summit organizers to minimise spending on
necessary items and aim for break even, to ensure as minimal a loss as
possible. However, the Board should be under no illusions that the event
will break even, and will likely make a loss of up to \$50k. 3. Debrief.
Once all bills are paid and certainly before AppSec USA, the Board must
have a one hour debrief with OWASP\'s Event Manager and the Summit
organisers to determine if OWASP will ever do such an event again, what
changes need to be made (regional / global, location, timing, funding,
marketing, media, etc), objectives hit, and lessons learned. Andrew van

member must attend at least 90% of the meeting, starting at the
published scheduled time until the published end time or the meeting is
adjourned (whichever is earlier). Attendance is tabulated by the

The following reflects the board attendance to meetings as a percentage
of regular meetings over the calendar year. Only regular meetings are
used in the calculations. Attendance means that the individual was
present for 90% of the meeting. Missing 10 minutes of a 1.5 hour meeting
qualifies as being absent for said meeting. For more information, refer
to the [OWASP Foundation Bylaws](../www-policy/legal/bylaws.html)

### Board functions

- **Vision, Values, and Mission**. OWASP has a new mission for the first
  time in 20 years. A strong and clear mission statement provides a lens
  for the Foundation to prioritize, do less of, or not do at all.
- **Strategic direction**. Each Board should set their goals,
  priorities, and strategic direction in a special general meeting early
  in the year
- **Fiduciary duty**. Directors are accountable for Board decisions and
  Foundation actions
- **Financial oversight**. The budget is set between September and
  November each year. It must be approved in the first general meeting
  of the year to permit spending on programs above the Executive
  Director's signing authority. If you want to get something done that
  will cost funds or bring money to the Foundation, it needs to be in
  each upcoming budget, or it won't happen.
- **Fundraising**. Every non-profit needs to fundraise. The Board should
  focus on fundraising by promoting OWASP and introducing new corporate
  members, sponsors, and donations to the Foundation.

The Board can make motions on any topic as long as they do not attempt
to bind future Boards or if a motion contravenes our mission, bylaws, or
policies. No Board may bind a future Board. Binding future Boards
doesn't work because every Board can change the mission, bylaws, and
policies and alter, reverse, or annul any past motion. The Board may
wish to undertake policy or culture reform or transformation. If so,
they should consult transparently and widely with key stakeholders and
the wider community.

### Running for election

If you are passionate about OWASP, being a Director of a non-profit is a
fantastic experience, but it can also be exhausting. If you have limited
time, being a Director may not be for you. Board officers have more
duties than General Members At Large. General Members at Large (i.e.,
those that aren't the Chair, Vice-Chair, Secretary, or Treasurer) are
strongly encouraged to be a Board champion for a mission goal, such as
Projects, Chapters, Members, Events, Outreach, or fundraising.

If you want to run for election, you must have 12 months of continuous
membership in good standing and nominate yourself when the call for
candidates comes out. Prospective Directors can find more details in the
[elections page](elections/index.html), including results.

### Onboarding for new Board Members

The OWASP Foundation will obtain or confirm every Director's current
contact details. They will ensure everyone has received the Board
induction books and BoardSource either electronically or physically.

The current induction resources and books are:

- [OWASP Bylaws](../www-policy/legal/bylaws.html) and [OWASP
  Policies](../www-policy/index.html){target="_blank"}
- [OWASP Restated Certificate of Incorporation
  2024](../www-policy/legal/OWASP-Foundation-Restated-Certificate-of-Incorporation-2024.pdf){target="_blank"}
- [Nonprofit Kit For Dummies 6th
  Edition](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119835720/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1){target="_blank"}
- [Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised 12th
  Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Roberts-Rules-Order-Newly-Revised/dp/1541736699/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=roberts+rules+of+order+newly+revised+12th+edition&qid=1642176682&sprefix=roberts%2Caps%2C118&sr=8-1){target="_blank"}
  or the [Concise
  version](https://www.amazon.com/Roberts-Rules-Order-Newly-Revised/dp/1541797701/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=roberts+rules+of+order+newly+revised+12th+edition&qid=1642176682&sprefix=roberts%2Caps%2C118&sr=8-4){target="_blank"}.
- [Board Source online
  training](https://boardsource.org/my-account/trainings/){target="_blank"}.
  The OWASP Foundation will provide a registration link to all Board
  members, and they should complete the training certificate found by
  clicking "My Account" at the top, "Training" on the left side, and
  then "Certificate of Nonprofit Board Education Series." It will take
  approximately an hour. Please provide the certificate to the
  Operations Manager before signing the Commitment agreement.

Every Director should have read OWASP's bylaws and policies to not take
actions or make motions that contravene them. These are not perfect.
Directors may raise enhancements or improvements that the Board can
address.

The Nonprofit Kit has sections relevant to the staff and more relevant
sections to the Board. Directors should read the entire book. As a Board
member, please read and understand Chapter 3: Prioritizing Your Board of
Directors, Chapters 7-10, Chapter 12 Budgets, Chapter 13 Marketing and
Branding, Part 3: Raising funds successfully.

RONR is used in special and general Board meetings to manage the agenda
and conduct business. You do not need to read the entire thing, but read
sections 44-45 for voting, 46 for elections, 47 for officers, 49 - 52
for Boards, 56-57 for bylaws. Many other sections are relevant, but RONR
is more used to establish an agenda and understand and follow a process
during meetings to avoid any perceptions or actuality of improper
motions. The Executive Director has the full version for reference
during meetings, so Directors may choose to buy and use the Concise
version. If there is conflict in meaning or understanding, the Executive
Director or Secretary will consult the full version in meetings.

There are optional but still recommended books for [NonProfit Financial
Oversight](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1974634205/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1),
[Nonprofit
Marketing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EEEOBGW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1),
[Nonprofit
Stragegy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D1RHSF9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1),
[Nonprofit Board
Fundraising](https://www.amazon.com/Nonprofit-Hero-Steps-Successful-Fundraising-ebook/dp/B07H46K25M/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=nonprofit+fundraising&qid=1642186393&sprefix=nonprofit+fund%2Caps%2C121&sr=8-5),
and more.

Directors can either submit an expense claim per the Expenses policy or
ask the Foundation to send the books to them.

### Completing Director qualifications

- If you are not a financial member, Directors must become a financial
  member by the time they join the Board **on January 1**. The best way
  to avoid any issues with good standing due to lapsed membership is to
  become a Lifetime member. However, Directors are recommended but not
  required to take out sufficient sequential one or two-year memberships
  to cover their entire term or enable automatic renewal in the Member
  Portal. Per the bylaws, Directors - and not the Foundation - are
  responsible for maintaining their good standing throughout their term.
  Directors wishing to use automatic or manual renewal must renew on
  time or check that renewal took place.
- New Board members must complete their induction reading and Board
  Source training before signing the [Directors Commitment
  Agreement](../www-policy/legal/directors-committment-agreement.html)
  to fully understand the role of the Board and their fiduciary duty to
  the OWASP Foundation.
- Directors who do not sign the [Director's Commitment
  Agreement](../www-policy/legal/directors-committment-agreement.html)
  are not covered by OWASP's Director's and Officers (D&O) insurance and
  may not sit or vote on the Board to prevent indemnity issues.
- Each year, the Foundation must obtain an updated [Conflict of
  Interest](../www-policy/operational/conflict-of-interest.html)
  questionnaire from each Board member. Directors can update this form
  at any time during their term. If a Director has a conflict of
  interest, they must [declare this interest to their fellow Board
  members, and recuse
  themselves](../www-policy/legal/bylaws.html#section-702-disclosure-required)
  from discussion and voting. Bylaws have precedence over policy or
  signed agreements if there's any confusion.

If a Director fails to meet the qualifications set out in the bylaws,
the Foundation will inform the *pro tem* Chair, incoming Chair, or
incoming Board as a whole. The Board may decide to vote to declare the
position unfilled through disqualification and then fill the Director's
seat per the [bylaw's vacancy
process](../www-policy/legal/bylaws.html#section-205-vacancies).

### Getting ready to be on the Board

Directors who can hit the ground running from the first meeting onwards
are a true asset to any organization. To get off to a great start:

- New Directors should come to any remaining Board meetings to
  familiarize themselves with Board meetings and meet their future
  fellow Board members.
- The Executive Director will meet with all Board members to listen to
  your platform, goals, agenda, and ideas to make OWASP better and
  achieve our mission. The new Board should meet in a Special Board
  meeting to decide who the board officers will be before the first
  general public meeting.
- The new Board should schedule one or two Special Board meetings in
  January of each year to set goals and strategies and communicate this
  to the community and Foundation. The Executive Director or Operations
  Manager will work with the Board to establish a public board meeting
  calendar. You will need to set aside two hours on the fourth Tuesday
  of each month and sufficient time to read the agenda and any
  pre-reading materials to prepare for the meeting. If you have any
  questions about the agenda or materials, don't hesitate to contact the
  Executive Director.

Please ensure that you have an up-to-date passport, all necessary
vaccination requirements to travel, and put time aside in your calendar
to travel and attend all in-person AppSec Global events. There will be a
public Board meeting at some point during the conference. AppSec Global
events are a chance to meet with OWASP Members, Corporate Members, Event
Sponsors, and participants and listen to their feedback and concerns.
Please make the time to attend all of the conferences. The OWASP
Foundation pays for board travel and hotels.

### Transition Process

From the end of the previous term until the first public Board meeting
following January 1 of each year, the following process will take place:

- Prior officers, if still on the Board, retain their position and
  signing authority until a new election of officers takes place.
- Officers who are no longer in office as of January 1 lose their
  position and signing authority, and their position will remain vacant
  until the new Board elects officers. Ex-Board members are not covered
  by Directors and Officers liability insurance, and so they cannot act
  as officers or Directors.
- Historically, the Board has permitted the previous Chair to open the
  first Board meeting to elect a new Chair and once elected, then hand
  over the meeting to the new Chair, even if the previous Chair is no
  longer on the Board of Directors. Alternatively, the incoming Board
  may choose to have the meeting called to order by the continuing Vice
  Chair or the Executive Director depending on circumstances. The
  incoming Board may decide to change this process.

To avoid a situation where the Foundation cannot pay its larger bills,
if all officers, or if all of (Chair, Vice Chair and Treasurer) are no
longer in office, the Executive Director (or Acting Executive Director)
will call a Special Board meeting to elect officers as soon as
practically possible after January 1. This meeting must be publicized
for seven days, so it may be published in the prior year. The Executive
Director (or Acting Executive Director) will chair the meeting until the
Chair is elected, call the meeting to order and ask for nominations for
Chair. The Executive Director (or Acting Executive Director) will ask
for a motion to close nominations and then ask for a vote. After the new
Chair has been elected, the meeting will be handed over to the new
Chair. All remaining officer positions will be nominated for and voted
upon in the same manner.

### Working with our community

Board members have higher requirements for independence to avoid any
perceptions or actuality of conflict of interest. Directors **must** use
their OWASP.org email address for all official business, not their
personal or commercial email addresses.

The public considers Directors speak for OWASP unless otherwise noted or
disclaimed. Directors should provide a disclaimer if they are
representing personal views.

**Build - not destroy by avoiding disputes** In general, the community
loves hearing from the Board. However, Directors can make fundamental
changes, so care is necessary when acting as a Director. Directors
should discuss, mediate, and listen to the community, rather than stir
up or participate in any disputes or try to get their way in the court
of public opinion. If you are passionate about a topic, bring the
community along with you and privately work to obtain the necessary
support on the Board to make the change you want to see.

### Working with the Foundation

The OWASP Foundation is there to enable and execute OWASP's mission, the
Board's strategy, policies, and goals. The Board has delegated
operations to the OWASP Foundation. The Board should not get involved in
day-to-day operations or approve policies that require volunteers,
members, Committees, or the Board itself to be on a critical operational
path of any program or business as usual process.

The Board is welcome to communicate to the Foundation through the Global
Board list, and
[email](../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#e4858a80968193ca92858a80819697908b878fa48b93859794ca878b89)
or [meet](https://calend.ly/owasped) with the Executive Director. The
Board should not ordinarily communicate directly with OWASP staff to
avoid the perception or actuality of many managers.

The staff is encouraged to raise any concerns with the Board if they
feel an issue that the Executive Director is not addressing. The staff
will directly communicate with the Board to complete or work on a Board
action from time to time. Please respond to staff requests or concerns
in a timely fashion.

The Board should track public actions arising from Board meetings, or
tasks delegated to the Foundation through the [Public Board Actions
Kanban](https://github.com/OWASP/www-board/projects/1)

### Working with committees

The Board has delegated some of its powers to various committees. The
Committees are governed by the Committees policy, advise the Board, and
have some decision-making power relating to their charter.

Annually, Committees provide a budget submission and objectives to the
Foundation for inclusion in the overall general budget. The Committee
can spend approved budgeted money but is not authorized to direct the
allocation of funds or spend funds for unbudgeted purposes.

Each Committee has its charter published on the main website. The Board
can make motions in areas covered by a Committee charter. For good
governance, the Board should consult with the relevant Committee and
stakeholders before passing any motion, consider their advice, and build
sufficient support within the community and Board for the motion to
pass.

### Making motions

The Board should be the primary source and driver of the agenda,
motions, and discussions. Please submit all motions to the Executive
Director no later than one week before a general public meeting. The
agenda can be published publicly with seven days' notice as required by
the bylaws.

All motions require a Board sponsor, so if a community member or staff
member wants to introduce a motion, it is through a Director's
sponsorship. Directors sponsoring a motion should prepare for a
discussion on the motion, be familiar with all pre-reading material, and
answer any questions about the motion. The sponsoring Director does not
need to support the motion and is free to vote against it. Most motions
require four "yay" votes. Changes to policy and bylaws require a
two-thirds affirmative vote (generally at least five "yay" votes). If a
Director wants a motion to pass, they should build consensus with the
Board well before the meeting.

### Agenda and Pre-Reading Material Preparation

The agenda will be finalized in a Board officers prep call seven days
before the general Board meeting, which is not a special or general
meeting. This prevents Board officers from conducting hidden votes.

The Executive Director will finalize all pre-reading material, staff,
and financial reports by the close of business on the Friday before the
Board meeting.

### Be prepared for each Board meeting

Well-informed Boards have efficient and highly productive Board calls.
Unprepared Board members violate their fiduciary duty to OWASP, create
unnecessary delays during the meeting, and likely misunderstand the
motions, devastating consequences.

Directors *must* read all pre-reading material, review (and potentially
correct) the previous minutes for accuracy, staff reports, motions, and
discussions. Directors should set aside an hour or two per month for
meeting preparation. Directors can ask to have the minutes corrected,
question the sponsors of motions, or ask the Foundation about staff
reports through the Executive Director.

### During meetings

The Board meeting will generally be online five minutes before the
meeting and start promptly. Any Director who is not present after the
first ten minutes is considered absent. Missing more than 25% of the
meetings in the year is grounds for a vote of confidence and potential
removal. An earlier Board made a convention that all Board members must
have their video camera enabled for virtual calls. If you need to have
your video off, please ask the other Board members before doing so.
