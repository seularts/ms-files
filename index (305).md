Hi and Welcome to the Philadelphia chapter homepage!

We are working to foster an open and accessible community of security
practitioners of all types. EVERYONE is welcome to attend our meetings
as we work together to raise the security awareness and skill sets of
all attendees through an open exchange of information. Come join us!

We are still charting our course! Come lend a hand! We are doing monthly
meetings that will be alternating between Speakers and our own TBD OWASP
Project. Please [email

any questions! See you soon.
