The [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)
Project](https://asvs.owasp.org/) held it's first ever, in-person,
community meetup during last week's [Global AppSec
Lisbon](https://lisbon.globalappsec.org/) conference. This was an
exciting opportunity for anyone interested in the project to come and
meet some of the leaders, discover how to get involved and learn about
our upcoming plans. We are super grateful to our friends at
[Jit](https://jit.io/) for their supporting in running the event.

This post is a quick summary of the meetup including key information on
how you can get involved!

## tl;dr

If you don't want to read all the blurb and just want to get involved,
you can either:

- See [a list of some
  issues](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1whuC4kfUwwiBRGP14um_IC5mOquawqFxtxWsF9Pf-Kk/edit?usp=drivesdk)
  where you could get started with working on the standard.
- See [a list of tasks/job
  roles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VUgbA1xjwRaOL9o8SYQqoGGrFNNobmid_FGS-ELVAzA/edit)
  which are not directly connected to writing the standard but would
  help us a lot and [a form to fill out if you are
  interested](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSda9V7dJ6h-YVsVRogi1hJGlhDANZXdUUyk7XQuaPpscKv2Bg/viewform?usp=send_form).

\

## The talks

As you can see from [our
agenda](https://owaspglobalappseclisbon2024.sched.com/overview/type/ASVS+Community+Meetup),
we had several talks planned as well as some informal discussion time as
well.

[Jim Manico](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmanico/) kicked off the
morning with a freestyle overview about the ASVS, giving some background
and context on the project to anyone who might not be familar with it.
This was followed by [Daniel
Cuthbert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-cuthbert0x/) dialing in
from the UK to give us an update on his outreach efforts with various
public sector organisations and government departments to get them to
incorporate ASVS in their guidance and regulation.

To finish off the first set of talks,
[I](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshcgrossman/) gave an overview of the
[guiding principles for version
5.0](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/wiki/Roadmap-to-version-5.0#key-objectives),
talked through our goal to release 5.0 by the end of this year, and
provided some more information on how you can get more involved (more on
this below).

\
After a break for informal discussions and then lunch, we came back to
hear a fascinating talk from [Irene
Michlin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/irene221b/) and [Aleksas
Spiridenkovas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksas-spiridenkovas-238a8a2/)
about [how they used Retrieval-Augmented
Generation](https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/asvs-security-graph-chatbot/)
to get better responses from a Chatbot when asking it which ASVS
requirements would be useful for a new software requirement or feature

\

Talks about applying the ASVS are always popular and this was no
exception!

\

## Discussions

We were able to have a number of discussions with current or potential
users of ASVS in between the talks and over lunch. These discussions
continued after the meetup as well, over both days of the conference and
gave us some great feedback and ideas for taking the project forwards.

\

## Opportunities to get Involved

One of the key aims of the meetup was to get more people involved in the
project. The more people who give their input, the better the quality of
the guidance in the standard. Plus, if more people get involved in
running the project itself, it makes it easier for the project leaders
to push things forward.

To that end, I had printed out a couple of posters to stick around the
meetup to let people know how they could get involved. (You can see them
dotted around the room in the pictures above).

If you want to get involved you can take a look at them here:

- The "WANTED" poster, [a list of some
  issues](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1whuC4kfUwwiBRGP14um_IC5mOquawqFxtxWsF9Pf-Kk/edit?usp=drivesdk)
  where you could get started with working on the standard (plus you get
  to enjoy my puns).
- The "Volunteer" poster, [a list of tasks/job
  roles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VUgbA1xjwRaOL9o8SYQqoGGrFNNobmid_FGS-ELVAzA/edit)
  which are not directly connected to writing the standard but would
  help us a lot and [a form to fill out if you are
  interested](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSda9V7dJ6h-YVsVRogi1hJGlhDANZXdUUyk7XQuaPpscKv2Bg/viewform?usp=send_form).

After the meetup, I also stuck the posters up in some other locations
around the conference as well. Thanks to
[Starr](https://www.linkedin.com/in/starr-brown-8837547/) for the idea
and also for helping us get set up and also to
[Sam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samstepanyan/) for publicising that on
Twitter which got us enquiries from people who weren't at the
conference!

## Our new identity

We also took the opportunity to showcase our new logo and branding
templates with roll-up posters and stickers, as well as special shiny
stickers and keyrings for people who have actively contributed to ASVS.
We have plenty of contributor stickers left to give out as well so earn
yours today ðŸ˜€).

## Next steps

We are super excited by the success and popularity of this event and the
interest in the ASVS. We are currently thinking about organising a
virtual version to bring this type of meetup to a wider audience.
