## Introduction

We are on the final countdown to the release of the [OWASP Application
Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://asvs.owasp.org/) version
5.0!

This will be a major release with a lot of changes to bring the ASVS up
to date and make it more usable. See [here for more information on the
guiding principles of the new
release](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/wiki/Roadmap-to-version-5.0#key-objectives).

We have now released a release candidate version of 5.0 and we are
waiting for your feedback!

## How can I help?

Reading through the release candidate version of ASVS is a great place
to start. We would strongly recommend that you use [the markdown
version](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/tree/master/5.0/en) as we are
constantly incorporating updates. There is also a [semi-official web
based version](https://asvs.dev/v5.0.draft/0x00-Header/) (maintained by
Elar, one of the project leaders) which is kept frequently updated.

A few questions to ask yourself as you review the document:

- If I was a developer or a security tester, would this requirement
  understandable to me?
- Can I think of a way of improving front / chapter / section text to
  add clarity without adding unnecessary content.

Please first log ideas, issues or questions here:
<https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/issues>. It's helpful to share if you
have any ideas or if you find any bugs or typos (but see the extra
guidance below).

We may subsequently ask you to open a pull request,
<https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/pulls>, based on the discussion in the
issue, if you are willing to do so, or we do that ourselves if you
prefer.

After familiarizing yourself with the current version and if you don't
have additional questions or feedback, the next area to focus on is the
"Issues" section.

The issues to focus on for RC1 are listed here:

<https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22_5.0%20-%20rc1%22>

## What's next

Our very own Elar Lang, the key driving force behind version 5.0, will
be presenting at [OWASP Global AppSec EU
Barcelona](https://owasp.glueup.com/event/owasp-global-appsec-eu-2025-123983/)
about the final 5.0 version so make sure you [check out his session
there](https://owasp2025globalappseceu.sched.com/event/1whCc/introducing-the-50-release-of-the-asvs)
in the builder track on Friday, 11:30am - 12:15pm.
