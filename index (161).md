# CycloneDX Bill of Materials Specification (ECMA-424)

OWASP CycloneDX is a full-stack Bill of Materials (BOM) standard that
provides advanced supply chain capabilities for cyber risk reduction.
CycloneDX is an [Ecma International](https://ecma-international.org/)
standard published as
[ECMA-424](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-424/).
The [OWASP Foundation](../index.html) and Ecma International [Technical
Committee for Software & System Transparency (TC54)](https://tc54.org/)
drive the continued advancement of the specification.

The specification supports:

- Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
- Software-as-a-Service Bill of Materials (SaaSBOM)
- Hardware Bill of Materials (HBOM)
- Machine Learning Bill of Materials (ML-BOM)
- Cryptography Bill of Materials (CBOM)
- Manufacturing Bill of Materials (MBOM)
- Operations Bill of Materials (OBOM)
- Vulnerability Disclosure Reports (VDR)
- Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX)
- CycloneDX Attestations (CDXA)

The CycloneDX project provides standards in JSON, XML, and Protocol
Buffers, as well as a large [collection of official and community
supported tools](https://cyclonedx.org/tool-center/) that create or
interoperate with the standard.

The projects website has many documented [use cases and
examples](https://cyclonedx.org/use-cases/) that provide a springboard
to SBOM adoption.

The project operates as a
[meritocracy](https://cyclonedx.org/about/governance/) whose [guiding
principals](https://cyclonedx.org/about/guiding-principles/) reinforce
its [risk-based approach to standards
development](https://cyclonedx.org/participate/standardization-process).
The project encourages [community
participation](https://cyclonedx.org/participate/contribute) in the
development of the [standard and supporting
tools](https://github.com/CycloneDX).

Strategic direction of the
[specification](https://cyclonedx.org/docs/latest) is managed by the
[CycloneDX Core Working
Group](https://cyclonedx.org/participate/working-groups/), is backed by
the [OWASP Foundation](../index.html), and is supported by the global
information security community.

## CycloneDX Unplugged

CycloneDX Unplugged is a community showcase of commercial and open
source projects that support or interoperate with the OWASP CycloneDX
Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) standard. CycloneDX Unplugged is part
of the [CycloneDX YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcUKDc0izYoyQKdzAsraoUQ).

A focus of the playlist is on the creation, consumption, analysis,
conversion, and distribution of CycloneDX along with the tools and
processes that serve to better operationalize SBOMs for greater
transparency and cybersecurity risk reduction.

CycloneDX Unplugged honors OWASP's mission of helping improve software
security in a vendor neutral way. Requirements for inclusion are:

- Any commercial or open source project that consumes, analyzes,
  produces, or distributes CycloneDX SBOMs.
- All projects or vendors have a limit of 3 videos that will be publicly
  listed at any given time.
- Videos must not exceed 15 minutes.
- Videos must be factual and describe capabilities currently available.
- Videos may be self-produced, or produced in collaboration with the
  CycloneDX Core Working Group.
- All videos will be edited to include a standardized intro.
