**OWASP** has forged a coalition between the global security community
and formal standardization bodies on AI. The **'AI Exchange' Project**
is now driving the creation of AI security standards that protect people
and businesses while still allowing innovation to thrive.

By establishing an official liaison partnership with international
standardization organizations, the **Open Worldwide Application Security
Project (OWASP)** has opened the door for its community of 8,500
security professionals to contribute directly to critical standards.
This partnership has already made a meaningful impact---especially on
key standards for AI security. Thanks to the active involvement of
OWASP's practitioners, the draft standards now include clear, practical,
and fair requirements.

The result is a more balanced approach to AI regulation: strong enough
to prevent harm to individuals, society, and organizations, but flexible
enough to support innovation. The foundation of this approach is
**risk-based thinking**---applying just the right amount of security
depending on the context rather than enforcing a one-size-fits-all
checklist.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why AI Security Matters

AI security is now a critical concern for three main reasons:

- **AI is being connected to everything.**
- **There are many ways to attack AI systems.**
- **Most engineers don't yet know how to make AI secure.**

AI has become an ideal target for attackers. That's why we urgently need
clear guidance and effective regulation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Role of OWASP in AI Security Standards

In **May 2023**, the European Commission launched the development of an
AI security standard as part of the **AI Act**. This standard determines
which AI products and services are allowed on the European market. It is
being developed by **CEN/CENELEC**, bringing together committees from 34
European member states and liaison organisations. The results are
expected to influence global practices---similar to how the **GDPR**
became a global benchmark (the "Brussels Effect").

Long-time OWASP contributor **Rob van der Veer** joined the working
group as co-editor and brought the **threat model** that he developed at
the Software Improvement Group and donated to OWASP in 2022. During his
work for the AI Act, Rob saw firsthand the urgent need for more hands-on
expertise---especially from researchers and practitioners.

To solve this, he founded the **OWASP AI Exchange** in October 2023 at
[owaspai.org](https://owaspai.org/). This open-source project brings
together experts to help shape global standards.

### Major Milestones:

- OWASP's **official liaison partnership** with CEN/CENELEC was
  **approved unanimously** by EU member states.
- OWASP contributed **70 pages of expert content** to **ISO/IEC 27090**,
  the global standard on AI security guidance.
- **40 pages** of OWASP contributions were added to the **AI Act
  security standard**.
- The **OWASP AI Exchange** was awarded **Flagship Project** status for
  these achievements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## A More Open and Inclusive Way to Create Standards

All contributions are based on the **200 pages of open-source material**
developed by OWASP AI Exchange, available at
[owaspai.org](https://owaspai.org/). This ensures that the expertise
shaping international standards is also **accessible to all**. It
promotes alignment across frameworks, tools, and regulatory guidance.

This open approach brings more voices into the standardization process.
Experts who are often underrepresented---such as researchers, data
scientists, software engineers, startups, and independent
contractors---can now help shape global policy.

As of **March 7, 2025**, the AI Act security standard has completed
consultation, generating over **900 comments** from member states,
liaisons, and the European Commission. The next step is **public
review**, and the OWASP AI Exchange continues to play a substantial role
in the process.

> "OWASP is excited about our ongoing partnership with CEN and
> CENELEC,"\
> --- *Andrew van der Stock, Executive Director of the OWASP Foundation,
> Inc.*

> "With access to our 8,500 members and more than 100,000 participants
> across our events, chapters, and projects, we look forward to shaping
> secure software standards for the future."

## What Do Industry Leaders Think?

**Dimitri van Zantvliet**, Director Cybersecurity, Dutch Railways (NS),
said:

> "In the railway sector, innovation and safety must go hand in hand. We
> are increasingly relying on AI to optimize passenger flows, monitor
> infrastructure, and enhance security. That makes it critical that
> regulation is both effective and innovation-friendly.\
> A risk-based, context-aware approach---like the one OWASP
> champions---not only supports the responsible use of AI, but ensures
> that real threats are mitigated without burdening engineers with
> irrelevant checklists. We need standards written by those who build
> and defend these systems every day."

**Sri Manda**, Chief Security & Trust Officer at Peloton Interactive,
said:

> "AI regulation is critical for protecting safety and security, and for
> creating a level playing field for vendors. The challenge is to remove
> legal uncertainty by making standards really clear, and to avoid
> unnecessary requirements by building in flexible compliance.\
> I'm very happy to see that OWASP has taken on these challenges by
> bringing the security community to the table to ensure we get
> standards that work."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What's Next?

OWASP continues to contribute to international standardization efforts
including:

- **OWASP CycloneDX** is being advanced as a **global standard via
  ECMA**
- New collaborations are underway for the **Cyber Resilience Act** as
  part of the **Open Regulatory Commission Working Group**
- **OpenCRE** has been adopted as a **central standards hub** by the
  Cloud Security Alliance, major vendors, and Dutch security standards.
