## SecureBank developer playground

Nowadays developers face not just new programming, but also security
challenges. They are not perceived only as code monkeys but are somewhat
forced to know the basics of DevOps, which brings us to SECDEVOPS. And,
despite their extensive effort to try and eliminate common
vulnerabilities, we can still find them in their applications.

## SecureBank - developer training

Our FinTech application project SecureBank shows how developers fail to
protect their environment due to a lack of knowledge about the applied
ecosystem. We will determine the deployment of docker microservice
solutions and where developers misconfigured their systems. Not only
security in the configuration, but we still have OWASP Top 10\* Web
Application Security risks out in the wild. Those vulnerabilities will
also be presented in the SecureBank application.

## SecureBank - hacker playground

The application is not designed just for developers but is also a
perfect starting point for hackers to start their path and challenge
their skills.
