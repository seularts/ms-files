\
The important values that are crucial in building a Cyber Security
Community are:\
\

1.  **Collaboration:** Cyber security threats are complex and constantly
    evolving. Therefore, a collaborative approach is crucial in
    addressing them. Individuals and organizations within the community
    must work together, share information, and collaborate on solutions
    to tackle cyber threats.\
2.  **Trust:** Trust is a fundamental element of any community,
    including the cyber security community. Members of the community
    must trust one another to share information and work together to
    achieve common goals. Trust can be built through transparency,
    honesty, and accountability.\
3.  **Education:** Cyber security threats are becoming increasingly
    sophisticated and widespread. It is essential that the community is
    educated on the latest threats and security measures to defend
    against them. Education can take many forms, including training
    programs, workshops, and sharing of best practices.\
4.  **Inclusivity:** A strong cyber security community must be inclusive
    and welcoming to people of all backgrounds, including race, gender,
    and ethnicity. A diverse community can bring different perspectives
    and approaches to addressing cyber security challenges.\
5.  **Responsiveness:** Cyber security threats can emerge at any time,
    and the community must be able to respond quickly and effectively.
    This requires a culture of responsiveness, where members are
    prepared to act swiftly to mitigate threats and prevent further
    damage.\
6.  **Innovation:** The cyber security landscape is constantly changing,
    and the community must be innovative in its approach to tackling new
    threats. This means embracing new technologies, tools, and
    strategies to stay ahead of the curve.\
    By embracing these values, OUR community can work together to build
    a Safer and Robust online world for all.
