## Welcome

Welcome to the OWASP Harrisburg Chapter! We provide a forum for security
professionals of all levels, from junior developers to CISOs, to connect
and enhance their security expertise. Our chapter will offer technical
discussions and training sessions focused on secure coding principles,
security testing, and integrating security throughout the software
development lifecycle (SDLC).

## Participation

The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit
foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our
projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to
anyone interested in improving application security.

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapters
Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/chapters). Financial
contributions should only be made online using the authorized online
donation button.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our
[Projects](https://owasp.org/projects/), [Local
Chapters](https://owasp.org/chapters/),
[Events](https://owasp.org/events/), [Online
Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/), and [Community Slack
Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/). We especially encourage diversity in
all our initiatives. OWASP is a fantastic place to learn about
application security, to network, and even to build your reputation as
an expert. We also encourage you to be [become a
member](https://owasp.org/membership/) or consider a
[donation](https://owasp.org/donate/) to support our ongoing work.
