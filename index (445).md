Welcome to the OWASP Cleveland Chapter. Reactivated in May 2024, it is
our goal is to meet monthly to discuss everything related to application
security. Join us at one of our upcoming events to engage in
conversations about the latest trends and best practices in the field.

## Upcoming Meetings

Join us on Tuesday, February 18th at [Market Avenue Wine
Bar](https://marketavenuewinebar.com/) for a hands-on lab demonstration
with Contrast Security. The presentation will go over features and
limitations of Contrast's next generation RASP tool. This session is
designed for everyone, whether you decide to participate or not.

Contrast is an Application Security solution used by companies like
AARP, InfoSys, Citizens Bank, Snap Finance, and more.
