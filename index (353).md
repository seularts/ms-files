Welcome to OWASP Ljubljana chapter homepage. The chapter leaders are
[Boštjan
Špehonja](../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#284a475b5c424946065b584d404746424968475f495b5806475a4f)
and [Mitja

## Call For Speakers

Call For Speakers is open. If you would like to present a talk on
Application Security at future OWASP Ljubljana Chapter events - please
review and agree with the OWASP Speaker Agreement and send the proposed
talk title, abstract, and speaker bio to the Chapter Leaders via e-mail.

## Participation

The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit
foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our
projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to
anyone interested in improving application security.

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapters
Policy](../www-policy/operational/chapters-2.html). Financial
contributions should only be made online using the authorized online
donation button.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our
[Projects](../projects/index.html), [Local
Chapters](../chapters/index.html), [Events](../events/index.html),
[Online Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/), and [Community
Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/). We especially encourage
diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is a fantastic place to learn
about application security, to network, and even to build your
reputation as an expert. We also encourage you to be [become a
member](../membership/index.html) or consider a
[donation](../donate/index.html) to support our ongoing work.

We will be running a Chapter Meetup every 2-3 months with the option to
have additional events such as hands-on workshops. It will be a mix of
in-person and virtual meetups. All our upcoming events are announced on
Meetup.

## Events

**Meet #3. Do WAFs make sense? - 21.3.2024 16:30 (Online)**

- Speakers: Gregor Ratajc, Matej Fajdiga
- Description: You might have heard about 'WAFs' (web application
  firewalls) from someone cold emailing you a commercial offer, or you
  might have heard about mod_security. Not sure what they are about and
  how they "secure" you? Say no more. In this presentation, we will
  delve into the realm of Web Application Firewalls, sparked by
  encounters with commercial vendors and open-source solutions like
  mod_security. Join us as we unravel the intricacies of WAFs,
  understanding what and how they 'firewall', and some techniques on how
  to bypass them, all in an effort to demystify their role in today's
  security landscape

**Meet #4. Silent killers of web applications - TBA (Online)**

- Speakers: Adrien Žitko
- Description: Injection attacks are a type of security vulnerability
  that can have devastating consequences. These attacks occur when an
  attacker manages to inject malicious data into your web application's
  database, leading to a range of negative outcomes, including data
  breaches, data tampering, and even complete system collapse. OWASP
  identifies injection attacks as one of the most critical security
  risks facing web applications today.

## Past events

**Meet #1. Opening session OWASP Ljubljana - Post quantum cryptography -
9.11.2023 16:30 (Online)**

- Speakers: dr. Nastja Cepak
- Description: Kriptografija je učinkovit način za zaščito zaupnosti in
  celovitosti informacij ter zaščito informacijskih sistemov pred
  kibernetskimi grožnjami. Kvantno računalništvo grozi, da bo razbilo
  večino današnje kriptografske zaščite. Čeprav že prihajajo poročila o
  prvih poskusih zloma uveljavljenih kriptografskih algoritmov, kvantni
  računalniki, ki so na voljo ta trenutek, v splošnem še niso dovolj
  zmogljivi, da bi jih razbili.

**Meet #2. Vulnerability Hunting With Static Analysis - 11.1.2024 16:30
(Online)**

- Speakers: David Petek
- Description: Static application security testing (SAST) tooling is
  commonly used in CI pipelines to catch security issues early. However,
  I see it used much less often to manually hunt for vulnerabilities.
  Let's say you found a vulnerable pattern in a million line code base
  and need to verify that there are no other cases, what do you do? In
  this talk I will try to convince you that if your answer is grep, then
  you are missing out. We will talk about SAST tooling, custom rules,
  custom tools and more.
