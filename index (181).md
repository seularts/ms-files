# OWASP BLADE Framework {#owasp-blade-framework .page-title}

::::: {#main .page-body .tab role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="main-link" tabindex="0"}

The Business Logic Attack Definition (BLADE) Framework, is an
open-source knowledge-base created to help cybersecurity professionals
identify the phases, tactics and techniques used by adversaries to
exploit weaknesses in the business logic of web facing systems (websites
and APIs). There are a range of attack frameworks (such as OWASP Top 10,
Mitre ATT&CK and Lockheed-Martin Kill Chain) available to allow
cyber-security experts to model and respond to traditional cyber-attacks
which aimed to exploit technology weaknesses in systems. These
frameworks are not well suited for modelling business logic focused
attacks yet these kind of attacks are becoming increasingly common.

The BLADE framework team have worked with a numerous security
professionals to capture real world experience into a framework that
captures the range of business logic attack types into a series of
comprehensive kill chains, to allow security professionals to take a
proactive approach in putting in defences against automated and business
logic targeted attacks.

BLADE already has a defined core team and governance model and is
currently licensed under GPL open source licensing.

### Road Map

As the BLADE framework is already in production outside of OWASP, the
roadmap may be slightly different to other less mature projects. The
core goals of the project leadership is as follows:

Immediate Aims:

To move BLADE v1.0 (stable release) into the OWASP ecosystem as a Lab
project Public release and community engagement - the BLADE leaders
would like to engage with OWASP to promote the framework in April 2025
if possible through press release / conference activity

Calendar Year 2025:

Conduct webinars, workshops, and conference presentations (OWASP events)
Expand contributor network for maintenance and future updates Develop
advanced use cases and real world examples of BLADE on the frontline
Publish case studies and success stories from organisations using BLADE
Move BLADE from Lab stage to incubator stage

Ongoing Maintenance & Future Enhancements (Calendar Year 2026):

Move BLADE into Flagship status Establish a long-term governance model
for maintaining the framework Incorporate feedback from new security
threats and industry changes Create training materials and courseware
Continue community engagement through workshops and collaboration
*Stretch goal* individual accreditation in BLADE *Stretch goal*
application accreditation in BLADE
