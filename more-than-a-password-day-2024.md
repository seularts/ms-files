Welcome to the annual More than a Password Day! To celebrate this year's
event, OWASP is enabling multi-factor authentication across the OWASP
Foundation's infrastructure. This is a significant step forward in
securing our systems and data. At the start of this year's event, we had
only 21% of all OWASP accounts enrolled in MFA. We're aiming to increase
this to 100% by the end of the year.

## How to enable multi-factor authentication on your account

If you haven't yet enabled multi-factor authentication, just sign in
today and follow the prompts. If you already have MFA enabled, you're
all set!

## How to run a security check on your OWASP account

We recommend you run a security check on your account to ensure your
account is secure.

- [Run a Google Security
  Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup)

## Use password-free authentication

Simpler to use and far more secure than passwords, passkeys use
cryptographic to prove that you are you. Once enrolled in Google MFA,
you can enroll in passkeys.

## Secure your email account

Email is the most common form of resetting your password. Add extra
security to deter access to your accounts:

- Strong password (long, randomly generated and unique)
- Multi-factor authentication / two-step verification

Password managers allow you to have unique, strong passwords for each
site, and can help you identify weak or reused passwords.

## Add layers of security

Additional security measures can help prevent phishing and other
attacks, if used in addition to your password.

- A hardware security key (or token)
- An authenticator app

Password managers often come with a built-in authenticator app, which
can be used to secure your accounts.

## Use a password manager

- Using a password manager means you can use strong, randomly generated,
  harder to guess passwords.
- Use a strong, memorable password manager password.

## Use a technique or passphrases to pick passwords

- Use "three random words" or passphrases to pick passwords that are
  easier to remember but hard to guess.

## Hacked? Move fast to change passwords

Your passwords should be changed immediately if:

- One of your devices is compromised
- If an online site or service you use is hacked

Using random unique passwords with a password manager means you only
need to change breached passwords. Many password managers can help you
identify which passwords need changing.
