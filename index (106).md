**The 1st Line of Defense Against Web Application Attacks**

The OWASP CRS is a set of generic attack detection rules for use with
[ModSecurity](https://modsecurity.org/) or compatible web application
firewalls. It aims to protect web applications from a wide range of
attacks, including the [OWASP Top
Ten](../www-project-top-ten/index.html), with a minimum of false alerts.
CRS provides protection against many common attack categories, including
SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting, Local File Inclusion, etc.
