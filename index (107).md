ModSecurity is the standard open-source web application firewall (WAF)
engine. Originally designed as a module for the Apache HTTP Server, it
has evolved to provide HTTP request and response filtering capabilities
across a number of different platforms including Apache HTTP Server,
Microsoft IIS and Nginx. It is free software released under the Apache
license 2.0 and remains the most widespread open source web application
firewall engine used by businesses, government organizations, internet
service providers and commercial WAF vendors alike.

The OWASP ModSecurity project provides the WAF engine. The engine is
usually coupled with [OWASP CRS](https://coreruleset.org/), the dominant
WAF rule set, that brings protection against HTTP attacks.

### Road Map

The project, started in 2002, is being [transferred from
Trustwave](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/trustwave-transfers-modsecurity-custodianship-to-the-open-worldwide-application-security-project/)
[to OWASP](../blog/2024/01/09/ModSecurity.html) in February 2024.

This will bring new life to ModSecurity and foster the creation of a
development community around it.

It is one of the tasks of the new OWASP ModSecurity project to define a
new road map.

### Communication

The website at [www.modsecurity.org](https://www.modsecurity.org/) is in
the hands of Trustwave. They plan to hand over the domain and the
website in Summer 2024.

Until that happens, this page here will serve as intermediary website of
the project.

Communication currently happens on the
[#project-modsecurity](https://owasp.slack.com/archives/C069PCXSW12)
channel on the OWASP Slack (the channel is public and you can get an
invitation to the Slack [here](../slack/invite.html)).

# CVEs

This page lists the official CVEs published since OWASP took over
ModSecurity from Trustave on Jan 25, 2024, and started it anew as OWASP
ModSecurity.

## CVE 2024-1019, 2024-01-30

### ModSecurity v3 WAF bypass (severity HIGH)

### Advisory

ModSecurity / libModSecurity 3.0.0 to 3.0.11 is affected by a WAF bypass
for path-based payloads submitted via specially crafted request URLs.
ModSecurity v3 decodes percent-encoded characters present in request
URLs before it separates the URL path component from the optional query
string component. This results in an impedance mismatch versus RFC
compliant back-end applications. The vulnerability hides an attack
payload in the path component of the URL from WAF rules inspecting it. A
back-end may be vulnerable if it uses the path component of request URLs
to construct queries. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to
3.0.12. The ModSecurity v2 release line is not affected by this
vulnerability.

### Components affected with numbers

ModSecurity / libModSecurity v3.0.0 - v3.0.11

### Fixed version

ModSecurity / libModSecurity v3.0.12

ModSecurity v2.9.x is not affected by this vulnerability.

### Download

Please notice that Trustwave Spiderlabs used to sign releases with the
personal key of Martin Vierula
(`F126692E9BA86B3958E73ED2F2FC4E45883BCBA4`{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge}).

The new OWASP ModSecurity project has created a new key and is now
signing releases starting 3.0.12 with the key
`0B2BA1924065B44691202A2AD286E022149F0F6E`{.language-plaintext

cfemail="c4a9aba0b7a1a7b1b6adb0bd84abb3a5b7b4eaabb6a3"}.

The key is present on most key servers. Here is how you can retrieve it:

:::: {.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}
::: highlight
``` highlight
$ gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key 0B2BA1924065B44691202A2AD286E022149F0F6E

### CVSS 3.1 {#cvss-31}

- **Score : 8.6 HIGH**
- Attack Complexity: low,
- Attack Vector: network,
- Availability Impact: none,
- Confidentiality Impact: none,
- Integrity Impact: high,
- Privileges Required: none,
- scope: changed,
- userInteraction: none,

It can be argued wether the Integrity Impact should be lowered to
"medium" instead of "high". After discussing this with our CNA NCSC
Switzerland, we concluded to put it on "high". If set to "medium", the
score drops to a "medium" level.

### CWE and CAPEC

- CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
- CAPEC-152: Inject Unexpected Items

In both taxonomies, CWE and CAPEC, we assigned very broad categories.
None of the more detailed categories were really spot on.

### Official CVE listing

<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1019>

### Longer description

The [OWASP CRS](https://coreruleset.org/) team has discovered an
unexpected behavior that can lead to a bypass in the
[ModSecurity](index.html) v3 release line (also known as
libModSecurity).

For a given HTTP request, ModSecurity3 performs URL decoding on the
request URL. For example, the percent-encoded character sequence "%3F"
is decoded into a question mark character, "?". ModSecurity later
separates the URL path component from the optional query component,
allowing for subsequent rule-based inspection of the path in isolation.
ModSecurity performs this separation at the first question mark
character encountered in the decoded URL as "?" denotes the start of the
query component. Crucially, ModSecurity3 performs the URL decoding step
before the URL path separation step.

It is thus possible for an attacker to craft a request URL that contains
a percent-encoded question mark character ("`%3F`{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge}") to trick ModSecurity into separating the URL into
a path component at a position of the attacker's choosing. This allows
an attacker to place a payload in the path of a request URL following a
"`%3F`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}" character sequence in
order to bypass the scrutiny of all rules intended to inspect the URL
path component. This is further facilitated by the fact, that the part
after the "`%3F`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}" is not
appearing as part of the `QUERY_STRING`{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge} variable.

The ModSecurity variables `REQUEST_FILENAME`{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge} and `REQUEST_BASENAME`{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge} are affected as these variables are intended to hold
the URL path, in full or in part, for inspection. ModSecurity rules that
inspect or make use of these variables are affected and may be rendered
ineffective against exploits of this vulnerability. This includes a
significant number of rules in OWASP CRS.

### The fix: Following the correct order of operations

Referring to the relevant RFC governing the use of URIs ([RFC
3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986)) reveals that this
is a known hazard. The RFC [explicitly
states](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.4) that
a URI must be separated into its component parts before performing URL
decoding in order to avoid mistaking an encoded character for a
component delimiter.

The fix was to modify the ModSecurity3 function that processes a request
URI. The URL is now separated into its components before URL decoding is
performed, removing the possibility of ModSecurity3 mistakenly using an
incorrect delimiter character.

### Example bypass

Consider sending an HTTP request with the following URL, which includes
an SQL injection payload in the path:

:::: {.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}
::: highlight
``` highlight
example.com/admin/id/1%3F+OR+1=1--
```
:::
::::

ModSecurity would perform URL decoding, which gives:

:::: {.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}
::: highlight
``` highlight
example.com/admin/id/1?+OR+1=1--
```
:::
::::

The appearance of a newly decoded question mark character tricks
ModSecurity3 into believing that a query component is now present.
ModSecurity3 now separates the URL path component from what it believes
is a query component and sets the path-related variables like so:

:::: {.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}
::: highlight
``` highlight
REQUEST_FILENAME: /admin/id/1
REQUEST_BASENAME: 1
```
:::
::::

The SQLi payload is no longer present, despite being a valid part of the
URL path. The payload will bypass the detection of rules that rely on
inspecting ModSecurity3's URL path variables. Unfortunately, the payload
is also not visible as part of the `QUERY_STRING`{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge} variable.

As demonstrated, this is a serious issue and ModSecurity v3 users are
strongly encouraged to update to the fixed release (v3.0.12) as soon as
is practical.

### Workaround

While upgrading to receive the fix is strongly encouraged, if upgrading
the ModSecurity engine is impossible for some reason then a workaround
can be implemented.

ModSecurity3's `REQUEST_URI_RAW`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}
variable contains the full URI and is unaffected by the URL decoding
step. Comparing it to the path-related variables from the previous
example, the raw URI variable looks like so:

:::: {.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}
::: highlight
``` highlight
REQUEST_URI_RAW: /admin/id/1%3F+OR+1=1--
REQUEST_FILENAME: /admin/id/1
REQUEST_BASENAME: 1
```
:::
::::

As such, it is possible to use the `REQUEST_URI_RAW`{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge} variable to derive all other required variables
correctly, including performing any required URL decoding. Note that the
raw URI variable also includes the query component, if present, and so
can be cumbersome and difficult to use.

Implementing such a workaround is likely to generate many new false
positives with existing rules. For ModSecurity3 users, performing an
engine update to receive the fix is likely to be a much more preferable
and simpler solution.

### Exploitability

As with every WAF bypass, it takes an additional vulnerability in the
back-end application for a successful attack. If the backend application
uses path components as query parameters as is likely the case for an
application with a layout as in the example presented under "Example
Bypass", then the application may be affected. This can be the case for
SQL queries (SQL injection), but also an exploit via a Remote Command
Execution (RCE) is possible in a similar constellation.

Again, the back-end must neglect input validation in order for this
exploit to work out, but the additional security usually gained from a
well-configured WAF is gone with this bypass.

### Timeline

*The timeline comes with a twist. Trustwave transferred the ModSecurity
project to OWASP during the window between report and release of the
fix. This means that the reporting organization became the new steward
of the open source software in question before a fix was released by
Trustwave. More to the point: OWASP CRS reported the problem and OWASP
recruited the new OWASP ModSecurity team out of the OWASP CRS team.*

### Acknowledgements

The OWASP ModSecurity team thanks the wider OWASP CRS team for their
patience. Unfortunately, this fix took far longer than it should. We
also thank Trustwave Spiderlabs, namely Martin Vierula, for the patch
for this issue and the support with the release process. Harold
Blankenship from OWASP Headquarters overlooked the transfer of
ModSecurity and helped with the timely setup of a new OWASP project and
GitHub organization. The OWASP project committee around Björn Kimminich
fast tracked OWASP ModSecurity to production level. And finally NCSC-CH
that supported us with the CVE process substantially. More than
anything, Open Source Software is a team effort. Thank you all.

## A Message From the New OWASP ModSecurity Leadership Team

*2024-01-26*

OWASP HQ has approved the intermediate leadership team for OWASP
ModSecurity. We say intermediate, because the plan is to bring the
community together in the 2nd quarter of 2024 and create a new
leadership team. This can be the same people or a new crew, but it's
going to be a team where the community has a say.

But during the setup phase of the new OWASP ModSecurity project, there
is no time for long discussions, though. Better get moving fast.

So here is the team of three OWASP ModSecurity Co-Leads for the time
being:

**Ervin Hegedüs** from Digitalwave in Hungary is a C/C++ developer and
long standing contributor to OWASP CRS. He knows the ModSecurity2 and
the libModSecurity3 code base and he contributed several pull requests
to the project. He is also providing ModSecurity packages on
https://modsecurity.digitalwave.hu/, a very popular service and he is
official maintainer for ModSecurity and CRS on Debian and Ubuntu.

Digitalwave.hu is a small service provider in Hungary. They are planning
to invest into ModSecurity given the new situation of the project.
Expect more news in coming weeks.

For the near future, Ervin will primarily focus on coordinating the
libModSecurity3 development and the development of the related
connectors.

**Marc Stern** from Approach-Cyber in Belgium is a long term ModSecurity
contributor with literally dozens of open pull requests on GitHub.
Interestingly, he is not active in the CRS community, so he contributes
with a perspective of somebody using a custom rule set that is embedded
in a complex management framework complementing the CRS capabilities. We
think this non-CRS perspective is an important counter weight.

Approach-Cyber is a mid-sized security service provider from Belgium
with offices in Belgium and - lately - Switzerland. Approach-Cyber has a
very strong ModSecurity offering and custom extension development
starting as early as 2003. They apparently see ModSecurity as strategic
for their offering with the board backing Marc's investment into the
code base.

Approach plans to contribute code that improves the software in the
following areas:

- Stability
- Consistency
- Performance
- Orthogonality
- Genericity

So clearly for a quality improvement of the code base.

For the near future, Marc will primarily focus on coordinating the
ModSecurity2 development.

**Christian Folini** from netnea.com in Switzerland is a long term
ModSecurity user and OWASP CRS co-leader with a lot of experience with
community building and project governance. He contributed very little to
the ModSecurity code base, but he wrote the 2nd edition of the quasi
official ModSecurity Handbook with original author Ivan Ristić.
Christian is a well known teacher on the subject and a long standing
figure in the ModSecurity / CRS community as well as the OWASP
community, that he joined 15+ years ago.

Netnea.com is a small Swiss consulting company focusing on network
monitoring and application security.

For the near future, Christian will primarily focus on project
coordination, communication, documentation and administration. Christian
plans to give up his leadership position at said community meeting
Spring 2024.

As you can see, we bring a lot of experience and credibility to the
table. We know what we are doing and we welcome this frest start for
ModSecurity with open arms.

We tried to balance CRS with non-CRS interests and we tried to bring in
a non-OWASP person (-\> Marc) into the team as well. We are all working
for small and mid-sized companies, definitely not big tech or startups
with a need for fast money. So we do this, because it's the right thing
to do.

Let's get going!

Ervin, Marc and Christian

## News From the OWASP ModSecurity Project

The following is a lose collection of news and status reports since
OWASP took over the project in Jan 2024.

### Status 2024-02-23

- We had more discussions about code, bug reports and improvements.
  Given we are seeking to build a new development company, this is a
  very good sign and deserves the top priority.
- With 3 open source SecLang implementations (ModSec v2, ModSec v3,
  Coraza), there is a growing need to coordinate the behavior, namely
  with implementation differences and new features. OWASP ModSecurity
  has proposed a SecLang round table and invited several stakeholders
  (Coraza and several rules projects) to discuss a pending problem. This
  meeting will happen in the coming weeks.
- Original author of ModSecurity, Ivan Ristić, presented at the OWASP
  London 20 years anniversary event about 22 years of ModSecurity. [Link
  to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbAVBQODDR0&t=3592s)

### Status 2024-02-16

- We had to roll back several commits on v2. This brought us to the
  conclusion we need CI/CD in place before we merge anything.
- So Ervin has set up a minimal CI/CD environment and development picked
  up again.
- We have established minimal review process that involves either Marc
  or Ervin signing off any pull request before merging for the time
  being.
- Technical discussions with more participants have started on Slack and
  on Github. Apparently a good sign.
- Christian did a presentation around OWASP ModSecurity, history,
  status, plans and an OWASP perspective for OWASP Netherlands.
  Recording will be published soon.
- OWASP CRS has released CRS 4. This includes a plugin functionality but
  more importantly for ModSecurity, it no longer depends on PCRE.

### Status 2024-02-04

- The first release under new management: 3.0.12. Given Trustwave handed
  over the repo with the fix for CVE-2024-1019 scheduled but not
  released, we had to get going very fast.
- The day after the release, a blog post went up that explains a
  different behavior in v2 and v3. It is in an area close to the CVE we
  fixed. We'll have to sort this out.
- ModSecurity development has started again and Marc has merged a few
  PRs that have been open for quite some time. One of them addressed
  longstanding problem with t:cmdLine (PR 3051).
- More talks with commercial integrators.

### Status 2024-01-26

- Trustwave has transferred the ModSecurity repo to
  https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity.
- The OWASP.org page at https://owasp.org/www-project-modsecurity/ has
  been launched.
- OWASP has confirmed the new intermediary leadership team: Ervin
  Hegedüs, Marc Stern and Christian Folini. A portrait of them is on the
  owasp.org page of the project.
- The OWASP project committee has promoted OWASP ModSecurity to
  production level. While this is only an administrative status, there
  is symbolic value in the promotion.
- Trustwave has handed over the Twitter (X) account to OWASP. Ervin and
  Christian are delegates on the account.
- Trustwave did not release the previously announced security fix for
  ModSecurity3. Instead, they have asked OWASP ModSecurity execute the
  release with their assistance. We are now aiming for Jan 29 / 30.
  (this came a bit out of the blue for us)
- Contact with an additional ModSecurity integrator established.

### Status 2024-01-19

- Trustwave has shared the patch for the upcoming ModSecurity3 security
  release with Ervin. He tested it and it looks good. Expect a release
  on Monday.
- We got two additional endorsements. More are promised and I might ping
  again.
- There is a vendor who runs ModSec3 with Apache. My contact is
  currently out skiing but he promised to call me after his return.
- Contact with OWASP project committee established.
- Ivan Ristić shared the trademark identifier for ModSecurity with us.
  The trademark is currently with Trustwave and OWASP will make sure
  it's transferred too.
- We're still waiting to get the github repo to setup an initial OWASP
  project page via https://github.com/owasp/project-modsecurity (does
  not exist yet). We're getting there, I'm sure.
- We have started to collect a list of ModSecurity vendors and
  integrators. Two people volunteered to do more research. If you are
  also able to contribute, then please get in touch.

### Status 2024-01-12

- Talked to 7 people / industry leaders about an endorsement of OWASP
  ModSecurity
  - Ofer Shezaf promised to write an endorsement on LinkedIn
  - Ryan Barnett tells me to use his twitter statement
- Addressed community via existing communication channels:
  - Trustwave Spiderlabs Blog
  - OWASP Blog
  - ModSecurity Mailinglists
  - Various social media accounts on Twitter / X as well as LinkedIn
  - Christian Folini's ModSecurity / CRS newsletter sent to 1950
    addresses
  - The only thing missing is a tweet by the \@ModSecurity twitter
    account
- Lined up a first podcast appearance, but it will be February or March
- Contact with OWASP project committee initiated (we know the process to
  become a flagship project now), but no real feedback so far
- We're making progress with forming a temporary leader team for the
  project (The idea is to run with a self-appointed leader team during
  the incubation phase and then let the community form a production
  leader team in Spring)
- #project-modsecurity channel on Slack established
- Apparently development has not really started, but ModSec3 is planned
  to get a security release on Jan 22 (bookmark that date, it has at
  least a medium severity) and Trustwave has asked OWASP to cooperate on
  that release.
- Got in touch with a commercial integrator who runs their own

  production hardened Apache connector.
