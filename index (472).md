### Understand what you hack, not how you hack it. (By Robbe Verwilghen, penetration tester and bug bounty hunter) {#understand-what-you-hack-not-how-you-hack-it-by-robbe-verwilghen-penetration-tester-and-bug-bounty-hunter}

***Abstract:*** Many people believe that technical knowledge and
programming skills are essential for being a successful hacker. While
these skills can certainly be helpful, they are not the key to becoming
a great hacker. Through real-world examples of bugs discovered during
his work as a bug bounty hunter and penetration tester, Robbe will
demonstrate why understanding what you are hacking is more important
than understanding how you are doing it.

***About Robbe:*** Robbe Verwilghen is an experienced bug bounty hunter
and penetration tester, who spent time at both the hunting and triaging
sides. He's the winner of 2024's "Hack The Government", organized by
CCB. He's currenlty consulting as a penetration tester at Toreon with a
focus on web and mobile applications.

### Real Stories from Behind the SSDLC Curtain; A Game of SSDLC Mistake Bingo (By Hendrik Noben, co-founder at Resilix and BSides Limburg)

***Abstract:*** In this talk, we peel back the curtain on the Secure
Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) and explore some real war
stories. Rather than focusing on idealized process models or textbook
solutions, this session highlights some messy, funny, and sometimes
frustrating real-world scenarios AppSec professionals face every day.
Each phase of the OWASP SAMM framework becomes a round of mistake bingo,
revealing lessons learned along the way. You'll laugh, you'll cringe,
and you'll likely recognize more than a few of these examples from your
own experience.

***About Hendrik:*** Hendrik Noben is the co-founder of Resilix,
focusing on cyber incident management and practical security assessments
that lead to strategic guidance. As trusted advisor, provinding a
pragmatic and people-aware approach to modern security challenges.
Hendrik brings a hands-on background as a penetration tester and
security architect. He is also the (co-)founder of BSides Limburg, a
community-driven security event in Belgium.

### A Mobile Security Crash Course: Application Security, Resilience, and Malware

In this talk, I will take you through the key aspects of mobile
security, focusing on three main areas: application security, mobile
resilience, and mobile malware. I'll begin by introducing the OWASP
Mobile Application Security (MAS) framework, sharing best practices for
securing mobile apps and addressing common vulnerabilities. From there,
I'll dive into mobile resilience, discussing how to protect apps from
reverse engineering, tampering, and cheating, with a link back to the
OWASP MAS strategies. Finally, I'll look at the increasing threat of
mobile malware, using a recent case in Belgium as an example to show how
malware spreads and what steps can be taken to defend against it. By the
end of the session, you'll have a well-rounded understanding of mobile
security and actionable insights to protect your mobile apps and users.

### Agenda (subject to change)

- 18h00-18h30: Welcome and refreshments
- 18h30-18h40: **OWASP Update**
- 18h40-19h30: [JWT security and exploitation (by Louis Nyffenegger,
  founder of
  PentesterLab)](#jwt-security-and-exploitation-by-louis-nyffenegger-founder-of-pentesterlab)
- 19h30-19h45: ***Break***
- 19:45-20h45: [Breaking and securing OAuth 2.0 in frontends (by Dr.
  Philippe De Ryck, Founder of Pragmatic Web
  Security)](#breaking-and-securing-oauth-20-in-frontends-by-dr-philippe-de-ryck-founder-of-pragmatic-web-security)
- 21:00: Close

### JWT security and exploitation (by Louis Nyffenegger, founder of PentesterLab)

**Abstract**: Nowadays, JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are ubiquitous, serving
as session tokens, OAuth tokens, or simply as a means to pass
information between applications or microservices. However, by design,
JWTs contain numerous security and cryptography pitfalls that can lead
to serious vulnerabilities. In this talk, we will explore how to exploit
some of these issues. We'll begin by examining some well-known
vulnerabilities, such as the 'none' algorithm and brute-forcing or
guessing the HMAC secret. Then, we'll move on to more recent issues,
including how an RSA public key can be computed from multiple signatures
to exploit algorithm confusion, and how a similar attack can be executed
against ECDSA. We will also delve into exploiting weaknesses in the kid,
jku, and x5u headers. Finally, we'll discuss how to leverage
CVE-2022-21449 to bypass the signature mechanism entirely.

**About Louis Nyffenegger**: Louis Nyffenegger is a seasoned security
engineer and the founder of PentesterLab, a platform dedicated to
teaching web penetration testing. With over a decade of experience in
cybersecurity, Louis has focused on penetration testing, architecture
analysis, and code reviews. He also launched a YouTube channel,
AppSecSchool, further extending his passion for education in application
security.

### Breaking and securing OAuth 2.0 in frontends (by Dr. Philippe De Ryck, Founder of Pragmatic Web Security) {#breaking-and-securing-oauth-20-in-frontends-by-dr-philippe-de-ryck-founder-of-pragmatic-web-security}

**Abstract**: Everyone agrees that Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a real
threat to browser-based applications, yet many underestimate its true
power. Common practices like using Single Page Applications as OAuth 2.0
clients, with techniques such as refresh token rotation, fail to account
for real-world attackers.

This talk will demonstrate two concrete hacks against frontend OAuth 2.0
clients, highlighting the underlying vulnerabilities. We will explore
how to address these security shortcomings by introducing structural
solutions like the Backend-for-Frontend pattern. By the end of this
session, you will be fully up to speed with the latest updates to the
"OAuth 2.0 for Browser-based Apps" specification, co-authored by the
presenter. You will walk away with a solid understanding of OAuth 2.0
security in frontends and best practices for securing sensitive
applications.

**About Dr. Philippe De Ryck**: Philippe De Ryck specializes in making
web security accessible to developers and architects, leveraging his
Ph.D. from KU Leuven to inform his comprehensive understanding of
security challenges. As the founder of Pragmatic Web Security, he

  (Proximus
  ADA)](#signaling-new-frontiers-ss7-insights---jeremy-schmidt-proximus-ada)
- 21:00: Close

### User Privacy in Online Location-Based Services - Victor LePochat and Karel Dhondt (Distrinet - KU Leuven)

**Abstract**: Location-based services (LBSs) have transformed social
interactions and personal experiences in the digital landscape. LBSs
stand among the most popular applications on major app stores,
appreciated by users for their capacity to enhance social connectivity,
enabling them to seamlessly connect with others, share locations, and
organize meetups. In this talk, we analyze the inherent privacy and
security risks associated with the sharing of personal information and
geographical locations in LBSs, with a dedicated emphasis on social
privacy. We explore the extent of data exposure and leaks present in two
popular categories in LBSs: fitness tracking social networks (FTSNs),
where we develop a novel inference attack to circumvent privacy zones,
and location-based dating (LBD) apps, where we assess which personal and
sensitive data is (inadvertently) shared with other users, including
victims' exact locations.

**About Victor Le Pochat**: Victor is a postdoctoral researcher in web
security and privacy at the DistriNet research unit of KU Leuven. His

### Leaky Forms: A Study of Email and Password Exfiltration Before Form Submission

Web users enter their email addresses into online forms for a variety of
reasons, including signing in or signing up for a service or subscribing
to a newsletter. While enabling such functionality, email addresses
typed into forms can also be collected by third-party scripts even when
users change their minds and leave the site without submitting the form.
Email addresses---or identifiers derived from them---are known to be
used by data brokers and advertisers for cross-site, cross-platform, and
persistent identification of potentially unsuspecting individuals. In
order to find out whether access to online forms is misused by online
trackers, we present a measurement of email and password collection that
occurs before the form submission on the top 100,000 websites. We
evaluate the effect of user location, browser configuration, and
interaction with consent dialogs by comparing results across two vantage
points (EU/US), two browser configurations (desktop/mobile), and three
consent modes. Our crawler finds and fills email and password fields,
monitors the network traffic for leaks, and intercepts script access to
filled input fields. Our analyses show that users' email addresses are
exfiltrated to tracking, marketing and analytics domains before form
submission and without giving consent on 1,844 websites in the EU crawl
and 2,950 websites in the US crawl. While the majority of email
addresses are sent to known tracking domains, we further identify 41
tracker domains that are not listed by any of the popular blocklists.
Furthermore, we find incidental password collection on 52 websites by
third-party session replay scripts.

### Cyber breaches and how to prevent them

This talk explains the common threats for software applications from an
attacker point of view, by using real-world data breaches and what the
attacked companies could have done to prevent it.

We have selected breaches of which technical details are well
understood, so we can use them as case studies, which we will approach
using the following questions:

- What happened?
- Why did this happen?
- What were the consequences?
- How can you prevent it?
