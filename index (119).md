The OWASP IoT Security Testing Guide (ISTG) provides a comprehensive
methodology for penetration tests in the IoT field, offering flexibility
to adapt innovations, and developments in the IoT market while still
ensuring comparability of test results. This guide provides an
understanding of communication between manufacturers and operators of
IoT devices, facilitated by establishing a common terminology. Its
methodology, underlying models, and the catalog of test cases present
tools that can be used separately and in conjunction with each other.

## Related Work

The concepts, models and test steps presented in the OWASP IoT Security
Testing Guide are based on the master's thesis **"Development of a
Methodology for Penetration Tests of Devices in the Field of the
Internet of Things"** by Luca Pascal Rotsch.

Test cases were derived from the following public sources:

## Contributing to the ISTG Project

*First of all,* [‚≠ê Please Give us a Star in
GitHub](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-istg)!

\

Thank you for your support and dedication to IoT security. The ISTG
project is an open source effort and we welcome all kinds of
contributions and feedback. To contribute, please head over to our
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-istg). Here, you can
review the project's documentation, code, and share your valuable
feedback. Your expertise and insights will play a crucial role in
improving the guide's quality and relevance. Whether you are an
experienced IoT security tester or someone passionate about ensuring the
security of connected devices, your contributions are highly welcome.
Join us in this collaborative effort to strengthen IoT security testing
practices and make a positive impact on the industry!

## üí¨ Participate in Discussions {#-participate-in-discussions}

Our [GitHub
Discussions](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-istg/discussions) are the
first place to go to ask questions, give feedback, and propose new
ideas. If your proposal qualifies for the ISTG, we'll convert it into an
"Issue" (the discussion might take a while).

**Help us improve & join our community:**

- üêû Report an error (typos, grammar) or fix it on a Pull Request.
- üí¨ [Give
  feedback](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-istg/discussions/categories/general).
- üôè [Ask
  Questions](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-istg/discussions/categories/q-a).

## üéØ Create Issues {#-create-issues}

Before creating a PR, first create an
[Issue](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-istg/issues "ISTG Issues") to be
discussed for missing requirements, content or errors.

- To avoid multiple people duplicating effort on the same issue, project
  leaders will assign it to only a few that will own it.
- Explain what you think is missing in the issue, including references
  (if available) and suggest where it could be added.

## üìù Open a Pull Request {#-open-a-pull-request}

You can contribute with content or corrections by opening a Pull Request
(PR). You can create a PR by following [these
steps](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).
Remember that:

- The target branch should be `master`{.language-plaintext
  .highlighter-rouge}.
- If your PR closes and issue, write ["Closes
  `#<issue-id>`{.language-plaintext
  .highlighter-rouge}"](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).

Your PR will be reviewed soon (refer to this page to learn more about
[reviews](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews)).

- Your PR may be merged after review.

> Learn more: ["(GitHub Docs) Reviewing proposed changes in a pull
> request"](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request).

## üìùContribute with content:

- üí° [Propose ideas or suggest
  improvements](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-istg/discussions/categories/ideas).
  If it qualifies we'll promote it to an Issue.
- üìÑ Create a Pull Request for concrete fixes (e.g. grammar/typos) or
  content already approved by the core team.

## üö´ What not to do {#-what-not-to-do}

Although we greatly appreciate any and all contributions to the project,
there are a few things that you should take into consideration:

- **No advertisement**: The OWASP IoT Security Project cannot be used as
  a platform for advertisement of commercial tools, companies or
  individuals. Technical content such as the implementation of certain
  techniques or tests should be written with free and open-source tools
  in mind. Commercial tools are typically not accepted, but might be
  referenced in some specific cases.
- **No unnecessary self-promotion of tools or blog posts**: If you have
  a relation with one of the URLs or tools you are referencing, please
  state so in the PR so that we can verify that the reference is in line
  with the rest of the guide.

If you have any doubts, please contact us.

\

## ‚úÖ Become a Reviewer {#-become-a-reviewer}

You can [Review Pull Requests
(PRs)](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-istg/pulls) and also gain
contributions. If you are a fluent speaker in different languages, feel
free to give feedback on any of the submitted PRs.

After your PR or issue has been submitted, we will review it as quickly
as possible which typically only takes a few days. If you think we have
forgotten about it, feel free to give us a nudge after 7 days have
passed.

## üîé Proof-reading {#-proof-reading}

If you do proof-reading, these are the things we're looking for:

- Content [cohesion &
  coherence](https://writing.chalmers.se/chalmers-writing-guide/writing-a-text/coherence-cohesion/)
  - is there a good linkage of ideas?
  - does the paragraph make sense?
  - does it make sense with the next one? think that hundreds of people
    have written in here, often without considering the surroundings of
    the text they were including).
- Reducing the content to a minimum (people tend to be very
  verbose/wordy) and in such a document we need clear and short/concise
  statements
- Optimize for *scannability* (maybe instead of a big paragraph it would
  be better to have a bullet point list).
- Any passive voice sentences? Convert to active voice.
- Does each paragraph focus on a single topic?
- Are key points stated at the start of each section?
- Are commas, parentheses, colons, em-dashes, and semicolons used
  properly?

  One](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one)

  Two](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/two)

## üåê Translating the ISTG {#-translating-the-istg}

Translating the ISTG in a new language is another great way to
contribute. This helps the project to reach to more people around the
world.

Before starting a translation please consider the following:

- **PLEASE** contact us on Slack or via email.
- We need your commitment. After the first translation is done, we will
  ask for your help to translate any new changes, so your translation
  can remain up to date.
- We need a second translator who can verify that the English version of
  the ISTG has been translated properly.
