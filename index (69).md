The OWASP SAP Threat Modeling Builder is an open-source project designed
to help SAP Administrators, SAP Security Administrators, and other
related professionals build an all-inclusive map of inter-SAP
connections. This tool enables the identification of potential security
risks and vulnerabilities within SAP environments, with a particular
focus on detecting connections between production and non-production
systems.

## Description

The SAP Threat Modeling Builder provides a user-friendly interface that
allows users to:

1.  Input credentials for multiple SAP systems
2.  Scan for and discover inter-SAP connections
3.  Visualize the SAP network as an interactive graph
4.  Identify connections with potential security concerns
5.  Filter connections based on specific criteria (e.g., stored
    passwords)

By providing a comprehensive view of SAP system interconnections, this
tool aids in compliance efforts and helps identify potential security
vulnerabilities.

## Key Features

- Credential management for multiple SAP systems
- Automated scanning and discovery of inter-SAP connections
- Graph-based visualization of the SAP network
- Tabular view of all connections for detailed analysis
- Filtering capabilities to focus on specific connection types
- Identification of connections between production and non-production
  systems
- Support for analyzing potential security risks

## Security Considerations

- **Credential Storage:** This tool stores SAP credentials in a local
  SQLite database. Ensure proper security measures for the database
  file.

- **Data Sensitivity:** The tool exposes information about SAP
  connections and potential vulnerabilities. Limit access to authorized
  personnel only.

- **Production Use:** This tool is intended for development and testing
  purposes. Evaluate its suitability before using it in production
  environments.

  ## Project Objectives

The main objectives of the OWASP SAP Threat Modeling Builder are:

1.  To provide SAP professionals with a clear understanding of their SAP
    landscape's interconnectivity
2.  To highlight potential security risks arising from inter-SAP
    connections
3.  To assist in compliance efforts by identifying unauthorized or risky
    connections
4.  To offer a visual representation of the SAP ecosystem for easier
    analysis and decision-making

## Use Cases

- Security Audits: Quickly assess the security posture of an
  organization's SAP landscape
- Compliance Checks: Ensure that production systems are properly
  isolated from non-production environments
- Risk Assessment: Identify and prioritize potential vulnerabilities in
  SAP system connections
- Change Management: Evaluate the impact of proposed changes to SAP
  system configurations

## Benefits

- Improved visibility into complex SAP landscapes
- Enhanced security through the identification of potential
  vulnerabilities
- Streamlined compliance processes
- Better decision-making for SAP administrators and security
  professionals
- Time savings in manual security assessments
