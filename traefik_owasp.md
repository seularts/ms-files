*Addresses crucial role of Web Application Firewall (WAF) in modern API
infrastructure and integrates two leading OWASP projects into Traefik
OSS stack*

**KubeCon, PARIS, March 19, 2024** -- Traefik Labs, creator of the
world's most popular cloud-native application proxy, today announced a
significant addition to their portfolio that addresses the escalating
cyber threats to modern API infrastructure.

"We are at a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital infrastructure,
where the integration of robust security measures within our API
gateways is not just an option, but a necessity," said Sudeep Goswami,
CEO of Traefik Labs. "By weaving the Coraza WAF and the OWASP Core Rule
Set directly into Traefik Proxy v3, we are not merely responding to the
current cybersecurity landscape but are proactively setting a new
benchmark for API security. This step reaffirms our dedication to
providing the most secure, cutting-edge solutions to our users, ensuring
they remain not just compliant, but ahead of the curve in the face of
emerging cyber threats."

By scrutinizing incoming traffic to block malicious requests before they
can exploit any vulnerabilities, WAFs have been instrumental in
safeguarding web applications and APIs, particularly excelling in
thwarting older, yet persistently dangerous attack methods such as
injection and security misconfigurations.

Recognizing the complementary strengths of API gateways and WAFs,
Traefik Labs has taken a pioneering step towards fortifying API security
with an innovative integration. The company has introduced the
capability to incorporate a WAF directly at the API Gateway layer.

Integrating a WAF at the API Gateway layer enhances runtime protection
and establishes a comprehensive security posture that is resilient
against a wide array of cyber threats. Available to users of Traefik
Proxy v3 open source, this innovation integrates two
[OWASP](../../../../about/index.html) projects: [Coraza
WAF](../../../../www-project-coraza-web-application-firewall/index.html)
and the [Core Rule
Set](../../../../www-project-modsecurity-core-rule-set/index.html).

"The integration of Coraza into Traefik Proxy represents a significant
leap forward in our mission to democratize high-level security for web
applications and APIs," stated José Carlos Chávez, co-leader of the
Coraza project. "This collaboration with Traefik Labs showcases the
power of open source innovation, merging our expertise in WAF
technologies with their leadership in cloud-native application proxy
solutions. Together, we're not just enhancing security; we're redefining
what developers can expect from their infrastructure in terms of
protection, performance, and ease of use."

This initial release lays the foundation for future enhancements and
signifies Traefik Labs' commitment to aligning with the evolving PCI DSS
v4.0 standards. With WAF transitioning from a best-practice to a PCI DSS
compliance requirement by March 2025, Traefik Labs is not only ahead of
the curve but is also setting a new standard in API security, ensuring
that organizations are well-equipped to face the cyber challenges of
today and tomorrow.
