machine to artifact promotion and repository. We will go through the
various stages of CI, identify potential security threats, and discuss
effective mitigations to ensure a secure and robust CI environment.

Guarding the Prompt: Building a Firewall for LLMs Aligned with the OWASP

down each risk, showcase practical defense strategies, and present a
live demo of an AI firewall in action. Attendees will gain insights into
securing LLM applications, understanding real-world attack scenarios,
and adopting proactive measures to future-proof AI systems. Whether
