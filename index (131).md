## Overview

OWASP Four Clover is a versatile file integrity monitoring tool designed
to bolster cybersecurity by ensuring the integrity of files,
configurations, and critical data. By monitoring and detecting
unauthorized changes, the tool provides a crucial layer of defense
against malware, intrusions, and security breaches. Whether you're
safeguarding system files, tracking configuration modifications, or
enforcing security policies, OWASP Four Clover simplifies the process
with user-friendly commands and insightful reports.

## Why?

- Multi-Hash Support: Unlike some existing tools that may support only a
  limited set of hash algorithms for file verification, Four Clover
  offers support for a wide range of hash algorithms, including
  blake2b-256, blake2b-512, sha256, sha1, md5, and more. This
  flexibility allows users to choose the algorithm that best suits their
  security requirements.

- Advanced Exclusion and Focus: Four Clover provides fine-grained
  control over which files are included or excluded from scans. The
  ability to exclude specific files or directories from scanning reduces
  noise and focuses attention on critical areas, enhancing the tool's
  efficiency and effectiveness.

- Focused Scans: The "focus" feature of Four Clover enables targeted
  scanning of files with specific extensions. This is particularly
  useful in scenarios where only certain file types are of concern, as
  it accelerates scan times and minimizes unnecessary overhead.

- Comparative Analysis: While many tools offer file integrity
  monitoring, Four Clover takes a step further with its comparison
  functionality. It allows users to compare two scan reports and
  generate detailed reports highlighting the changes between them. This
  facilitates rapid detection of alterations, aiding in incident
  response and forensics.

- Policy-Based Scanning: Four Clover introduces a policy-driven approach
  to file integrity monitoring. By defining policies based on specific
  rules, users can tailor scans to detect deviations from expected
  configurations. This mechanism empowers organizations to enforce
  security standards and practices more effectively.

- Simplicity and Ease of Use: Four Clover is designed with
  user-friendliness in mind. Its intuitive command-line interface and
  clear reporting structure make it accessible to both novice and
  experienced users, reducing the learning curve and streamlining
  adoption.

- Comprehensive Reporting: The tool generates comprehensive reports
  detailing scan results, changes, and findings. These reports offer
  detailed insights into alterations, supporting both compliance and
  incident response efforts.

- Active OWASP Involvement: As part of the OWASP Foundation, Four Clover
  benefits from community-driven development, review, and security
  scrutiny. This level of collaboration ensures ongoing improvement and
  alignment with best practices.

- Integration Capabilities: Four Clover's extensible design enables
  integration into DevSecOps pipelines and other security toolchains.
  This seamless integration enhances the overall security posture of
  software development and deployment processes.

- Responsive Development: Four Clover's open-source nature fosters a
  responsive development community. The tool can evolve rapidly to
  address emerging threats and adapt to changing cybersecurity
  landscapes.
