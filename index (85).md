## Our Co-hosts

Starting in 2022, the OWASP Podcast will be the combined efforts of 3
co-hosts, each producing episodes with a slightly different focus:

### [Mark Miller](../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#b5d8d4c7de9bd8dcd9d9d0c7f5dac2d4c6c59bdac7d2) - Executive Producer since 2013. {#mark-miller---executive-producer-since-2013}

Mark Miller has been the Executive Producer of the OWASP Podcast Series
since accepting the reins from Jim Manico in 2013. During his tenure,
Mark has produced 160 broadcasts, with a combined total of over 500,000
downloads. For his episodes in 2022, Mark will continue to interview
cybersecurity and open source experts who are making the greatest impact
on security within the technology industry.

### [Matt Tesauro](../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#a2cfc3d6d68cd6c7d1c3d7d0cde2cdd5c3d1d28ccdd0c5) - filled in for Jim Manico in the early days and is back for more. {#matt-tesauro---filled-in-for-jim-manico-in-the-early-days-and-is-back-for-more}

Matt Tesauro is focusing on speaking to OWASP project leaders and other
AppSec professionals to share knowledge learned in the AppSec and
DevSecOps 'trenches'. Episodes are focused on helping listeners up their
AppSec / DevSecOps game by sharing experiences, tools and techniques
that others have found useful.

### [Vandana Verma Sehgal](../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#5721363933363936792132253a3617382036242779382530) - started a podcast focusing on OWASP internal news before merging with the project. {#vandana-verma-sehgal---started-a-podcast-focusing-on-owasp-internal-news-before-merging-with-the-project}

Vandana Verma, Joubin Jabbari and Didar Gelici will continue to produce
a conversational podcast covering interesting items of OWASP news,
information and updates to help you keep current on chapters, projects,
events and more.
