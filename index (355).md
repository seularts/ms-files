## CTF 2024

We are thrilled to announce the results of the recent OWASP Limassol
Meetup, where participants engaged in a challenging and exhilarating LLM
application hacking activity. The event was a resounding success,
showcasing the remarkable skills and talents of our community members.

Event Highlights Recap:

- LLM Application Challenge by [TODO: security](https://todo.security/):
  Participants tested their skills by bypassing security mechanisms and
  exploiting basic LLM misconfigurations to uncover a secret string. The
  challenge featured multiple levels of increasing difficulty,
  culminating in a series of web exploitation tasks.

## CTF 2023

🔐 The recently concluded OWASP Limassol Qualifying CTF brought together
cyber enthusiasts for an exhilarating PvP experience!

Attention all cybersecurity aficionados and budding ethical hackers! The
time has come and gone to test your mettle and dive into the thrilling
realm of Capture The Flag (CTF) contests. The Island Hack and Learn CTF
event by OWASP Limassol recently showcased an event that put your
knowledge to the test, stretched your boundaries, and recognized your
hard work!

The Qualifying CTF spanned across 3 days and encompassed 5 tasks
covering a range of Information Security topics. We celebrated the
achievements of 4 winners who scored the highest points within a brief
timeframe. If you were part of this exciting journey, you can relish the
memories of the competition that just took place.

## 🤩 Offline PvP Battles: {#-offline-pvp-battles}

Following the conclusion of the online Qualifying CTF, participants
engaged in an electrifying offline PvP battle that had pulses racing!
Cybersecurity warriors had the chance to meet in person, exchange
insights, build valuable connections, and enjoy friendly competition.

The showdown kicked off as a segment of the OWASP Limassol Meetup 2.0
event. It consisted of 3 rounds featuring 3 tasks for the 4 winners of
the Qualifying online CTF. These tasks spanned various categories, and
participants needed to eliminate one category in each round based on the
speed of their solutions 😀 The last individual to solve the task in
each round would be eliminated. The battles were anticipated to last no
more than 20 minutes each, with a demonstration screen and audience
support adding to the excitement -- a fantastic opportunity to gain a
fan following. ![PvP](assets/images/pvp1.jpg)

Ultimately, a solitary champion emerged from the offline battle, while
the remaining participants earned boundless respect from the community
for their spirited involvement. ![PvP](assets/images/pvp2.jpg)
