> # OWTF is taking part in the Google Summer of Code 2025 ! If you'd like to participate then see the [OWASP Google Summer of Code 2025 Ideas page](../www-community/initiatives/gsoc/gsoc2025ideas.html)! {#owtf-is-taking-part-in-the-google-summer-of-code-2025--if-youd-like-to-participate-then-see-the-owasp-google-summer-of-code-2025-ideas-page}

OWTF aims to make pen testing:

- Aligned with OWASP Testing Guide + PTES + NIST
- More efficient
- More comprehensive
- More creative and fun (minimise un-creative work)

so that pentesters will have more time to

- See the big picture and think out of the box
- More efficiently find, verify and combine vulnerabilities
- Have time to investigate complex vulnerabilities like business
  logic/architectural flaws or virtual hosting sessions
- Perform more tactical/targeted fuzzing on seemingly risky areas
- Demonstrate true impact despite the short timeframes we are typically
  given to test.

> ### **You can get the latest version of OWASP OWTF by cloning the develop branch at https://github.com/owtf/owtf** {#you-can-get-the-latest-version-of-owasp-owtf-by-cloning-the-develop-branch-at-httpsgithubcomowtfowtf}

OWTF attempts to solve the "penetration testers are never given enough
time to test properly" problem, or in other words, OWTF = Test/Exploit
ASAP, with this in mind, as of right now, the priorities are:

- To improve security testing efficiency (i.e. test more in less time)
- To improve security testing coverage (i.e. test more)
- Gradually integrate the best tools
- Unite the best tools and make them work together with the security
  tester
- Remove or Reduce the need to babysit security tools during security
  assessments
- Be a respository of PoC resource links to assist exploitation of
  vulnerabilities in order to illustrate risk to businesses.
- Help penetration testers save time on report writing
