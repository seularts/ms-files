In an age of AI-generated code, it's more important than ever to confirm
whether new code - or an AI-generated fix - is truly secure. While
existing resources like OWASP Cheat Sheets and CWE provide valuable
guidance and examples, this project goes a step further by showing
exactly how those principles apply in real-world scenarios, using a
library of deliberately insecure and secure code samples tested by
various attack payloads (e.g. from PayloadsAllTheThings). By aligning
with recommendations from the Cheat Sheets Series and organizing
everything as pass/fail tests, developers can compare the effectiveness
of different remediation approaches, validate their own fixes, and gain
truly practical insights. The result is a hands-on resource that
complements established best-practice guidance - and acts like a "Stack
Overflow" for security fixes - by making vulnerability mitigation both
discoverable and verifiable.

### Road Map

A working proof of concept has been created in Java, demonstrating the
Path Traversal vulnerability The project will be expanded in several
directions:

- Broader vulnerability coverage -- Add new examples of both insecure
  and secure implementations for a wide range of vulnerability types.
- Enhanced test payloads -- Increase the variety and sophistication of
  attack payloads to test the robustness of different fixes.
- Multi-language support -- Extend the project to cover multiple
  programming languages and popular frameworks.

The timeline depends on available contributors and community support.
The initial goal is to cover the most common SAST-detectable
vulnerabilities within the first year, starting with XXE, Command
Injection, and SQL Injection. Overall, this is envisioned as a
long-term, multi-year project aimed at becoming a comprehensive and
evolving resource for secure coding practices.
