#### Our Guest: Sebastien Deleersnyder

Sebastien Deleersnyder (https://twitter.com/sebadele) is co-founder, CEO
of Toreon and a proponent of application security as a holistic
endeavor. He started the Belgian OWASP chapter, was a member of the
OWASP Foundation Board and performed several public presentations on
Application Security. Seba also co-founded the yearly security & hacker
BruCON conference and trainings in Belgium. With a background in
development and many years of experience in security, he has trained
countless developers to create software more securely. He has led OWASP
projects such as OWASP SAMM, thereby truly making the world a little bit
safer. Now he is adapting application security models to the evolving
field of DevOps and is also focused on bringing Threat Modeling to a
wider audience.

#### Description

OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) enables you to formulate
and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the
risk profile of your organisation. In this talk, we give an overview of
the new release of the SAMM model. After 10 years since its first
conception, it was important to align it with today's development
practices. We will cover a number of topics in the talk: the core
structure of the model, which was redesigned and extended to align with
modern development practices, the measurement model which was setup to
cover both coverage and quality and the new security practice streams
where the SAMM activities are grouped in maturity levels. We will
demonstrate the new SAMM2 toolbox to measure the maturity of an example
development team and how you can create a roadmap of activities.

#### Hands-on Description

Generally, it is much less expensive to build secure software than to
correct security issues after the software package has been completed,
not to mention the costs that may be associated with a security breach.
We will discuss how to embed security in the SDLC and how to design a
secure application architecture.

The following areas will presented:
