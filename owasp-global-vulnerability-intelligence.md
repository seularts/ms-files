In response to increasing concerns over the effectiveness of the CVE
Program and the sustainability of the U.S. government's role in managing
the world's largest vulnerability database, cybersecurity leaders and
international stakeholders are coming together to explore a federated
model for vulnerability identification. The initiative seeks to address
modern security challenges---such as the shift toward hyper-automation,
the dominance of open-source software, and emerging needs in
cryptography, artificial intelligence, and other specialized
domains---by fostering global collaboration and innovation.

The cybersecurity community faces a pivotal moment. Recent reductions in
funding for MITRE's support of the CVE program have sparked widespread
concern that the world's largest vulnerability database can no longer
keep pace with the demands of a rapidly evolving global threat
landscape. Originally designed for a time when most software was
commercial and automation was in its infancy, the CVE program and the
National Vulnerability Database (NVD) struggle to meet the needs of an
ecosystem increasingly dominated by open-source software. In fact, by
some estimates, over 90% of all modern applications rely on open-source
components, and yet the CVE program often fails to capture these
vulnerabilities quickly or effectively.

These challenges are compounded by emerging cybersecurity needs that
extend beyond traditional software vulnerabilities. For example,
identifying weaknesses in cryptographic algorithms such as AES-128,
which are not "vulnerabilities" in the traditional sense, or documenting
cybersecurity issues in AI systems, medical devices, and other complex
domains.

In parallel, new trends in cybersecurity have highlighted the
limitations of centralized authority. The international community
increasingly questions whether any single government or organization can
sustainably serve as the sole steward of global vulnerability
information. A centralized model, while historically effective, now
appears to be a point of weakness, particularly as the breadth and scope
of cybersecurity threats expand.

"The shift toward a federated model reflects a growing need for a more
agile, community-driven approach. By engaging an international coalition
of experts and stakeholders, we can overcome the limitations of
centralized systems and deliver a solution that scales with the
complexity of today's software ecosystems," says Steve Springett, Chair
of OWASP CycloneDX and Ecma TC54 and Vice Chair of the OWASP Global
Board of Directors.

## Exploring a Decentralized Model

The international cybersecurity community must come together to explore
a new approach---one that evolves beyond a single, central authority.
This is not about "fixing" the CVE Program or the NVD. Instead, it's a
call to action to envision a decentralized model supported by an
international coalition.

This model would decentralize responsibility, enabling transparent,
scalable, and open sharing of cybersecurity data. It would leverage the
expertise of communities already shaping best practices and
standards---such as OWASP's vibrant GenAI and supply chain
communities---while encouraging participation from underrepresented
sectors, including medical device manufacturers and other industry
groups. The goal is to create a flexible, extensible system capable of
capturing not only traditional vulnerabilities, but also a broader range
of cybersecurity issues, all within a robust and resilient federated
structure.

This initiative is in its early stages. There are no answers---yet. But
the growing consensus among international stakeholders is clear: we need
a modernized, federated approach to cybersecurity records that reflects
the complexity, diversity, and global nature of today's security
challenges.

"OWASP has long been at the forefront of advancing open and transparent
security standards. This initiative aligns perfectly with our mission to
empower the global community to develop secure software. Together, we
can redefine how vulnerability intelligence is published and consumed,"
states Andrew van der Stock, Executive Director of the OWASP Foundation.

## Join Us in Building the Future

We are calling on governments, industry leaders, researchers, and
community experts to contribute their voices, expertise, and resources.
Together, we can build an alternative model that complements existing
efforts, gradually replacing outdated approaches with a federated,
community-driven, and international standard.

The future of cybersecurity identification depends on global
collaboration. Let's build it together.
