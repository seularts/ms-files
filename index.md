## Strategies from the operating plan

- OWASP is run by the community, for the benefit of the community
- OWASP Foundation enables the mission, not does the mission
- All mission areas must be profitable in their own right, able to earn,
  and transparently and accountably spend approved funds
- Prioritize and focus on community and outreach activities that drive
  our mission
