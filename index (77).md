# What is Raider

![Raider logo](assets/images/raider_logo.png)

This is a framework initially designed to test and automate the
authentication process for web applications, and by now it has evolved
and can be used for all kinds of stateful HTTP processes. It abstracts
the client-server information exchange as a finite state machine. Each
step comprises one request with inputs, one response with outputs,
arbitrary actions to do on the response, and conditional links to other
stages. Thus, a graph-like structure is created.

Raider's configuration is inspired by Emacs. Hylang is used, which is
LISP on top of Python. LISP is used because of its "Code is Data, Data
is Code" property. With the magic of LISP macros generating
configuration automatically becomes easy. Flexibility is in its DNA,
meaning it can be infinitely extended with actual code. You can use it
for example to create, store, reproduce, and share proof-of-concepts
easily for HTTP attacks. With Raider you can also search through your
Projects, filter by hyfile, Flows, FlowGraphs, etc... Then you run
either just one step, or a chain of steps, so you can automate and run
tests on any HTTP process.

# Graph-like architecture

Raider defines a DSL to describe the information flow between the client
and the server for HTTP processes. Each step of the process is described
by a Flow, which contains the Request with inputs, Response with
outputs, and arbitrary actions including links to other Flows:

Chaining several Flows together can be used to simulate any stateful
HTTP process. FlowGraphs indicate the starting point. They can be placed
on any Flow. A FlowGraphs runs all Flows in the link until
Success/Failure is returned or if there are no more links.
