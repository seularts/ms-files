## OWASP Web Mapper Project

What if there are quite a few web applications under your organization,
but nobody seems to know all of them (before the talk of application
risk assessment)? Then this project may be a right fit for you.

This project is designed to perform the web application asset discovery
and auto tracking with scale.

## Description

A pure Ruby library for the web application asset discovery and
tracking. The tool is useful when you're handling a larger size
organization with multiple Internet domains and networks registered
under the name. Where both legacy and new web applications are
omni-present but nobody seems to be able to provide a complete list of
application URLs to you. Yes you can always do it the old way by using
tool sets such as NMAP, OWASP Zap web crawler, along with others. But
such tool sets could quickly become too much manual-driven and
inaccurate, if not impossible. In the contrary, once setup, this project
will help you quickly identify all the 'unknown' web application asset,
and keep track of them automatically. If you are serious about your
organization's Internet web application exposure, this might be the
perfect all-in-one foot-printing tool you're looking for.

Built as an open source project, the source code is both free and
scalable. You're welcome to keep building on top of the current code
base, or include it as part of your larger project distribution.

## Demo

The complete product is deployed into a demo instance at
