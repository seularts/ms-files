## Welcome

Welcome to the OWASP Bergen chapter. We strive to be an open and
including community for everyone. Please refer to [Code of
conduct](../www-policy/operational/code-of-conduct/index.html){target="_blank"}.

We are a newly approved chapter and this page is still under
construction. This page will be updated shortly with a meetup group, and
check back later for events.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact one of the leaders
by mail.

## Participation

The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit
foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our
projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to
anyone interested in improving application security.

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapters
Policy](../www-policy/operational/chapters-2.html). Financial
contributions should only be made online using the authorized online
donation button.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our
[Projects](../projects/index.html), [Local
Chapters](../chapters/index.html), [Events](../events/index.html),
[Online
Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/){target="_blank"}, and
[Community Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/){target="_blank"}. We
especially encourage diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is a
fantastic place to learn about application security, to network, and
even to build your reputation as an expert. We also encourage you to be
[become a member](../membership/index.html) or consider a
[donation](../donate/index.html) to support our ongoing work.
