This is a documentation project that discusses the importance and
benefits of establishing a security culture when building an application

Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC), helping to create secure
development practices. Topics discussed include: Defining a maturity
goal; Collaboration between security and development teams; Security
Champions; Activities, such as Capture the Flag; Threat modelling;
Security testing; Metrics; all with references to useful relevant OWASP
projects.
