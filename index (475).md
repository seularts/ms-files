## Welcome

At OWASP Beja, we believe that **knowledge sharing and collaboration are
key to create and spread security awareness**. Our chapter is a platform
where individuals can come together to exchange ideas, learn from
experts, and [contribute to the security
landscape](#speaking-at-owasp-beja-chapter-events). Whether you are an
experienced professional, a student eager to learn, or someone
passionate about cybersecurity, then this is the right place for you!
