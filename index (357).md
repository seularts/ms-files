### Participation

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit
foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our
projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to
anyone interested in improving application security.

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the NEW Chapter
Policy. To be a SPEAKER at ANY OWASP Chapter in the world simply contact
the local chapter leader with details of what OWASP Project, independent
research, or related software security topic you would like to present.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our
[Projects](https://owasp.org/projects/), [Local
Chapters](https://owasp.org/chapters),
[Events](https://owasp.org/events), [Online
Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/), and [Community
Slack](https://owasp.slack.com/). We especially encourage diversity in
all our initiatives. OWASP is a fantastic place to learn about
application security, network with like-minded people, and even build
your reputation as a professional. We also encourage you to be [become a
