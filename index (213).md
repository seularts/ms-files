## Mission Statement

**To provide the support and guidance required by Projects to thrive and
contribute to the overall mission and goals of OWASP.**

## Objectives and Tasks

The Project Committee intends to address these key problems:

- Currently, project management is a hard and sometimes tiring job
- Many projects do not feel sufficiently supported by OWASP

As one of the three legs that support OWASP (Foundation, Chapters and
Projects), Projects are a critical part of moving the OWASP mission
forward. The Project Committee's purpose is to help ensure that the
quality, lifecycle, and teams are supported as per the Project Committee
Scope.

## Scope

- Promote project activity, and provide mentorship and guidance to
  project leads and team members.
- Maintain the project lifecycle within OWASP, including working with
  staff to improve procedures, and documenting guidelines in an updated
  or re-written Project Handbook.
- Work with OWASP projects and establish any processes to assist
  projects to achieve flagship level status, including deleting,
  revising, or establishing a project review process
- Evangelize OWASP projects publicly, including working with outside
  projects to become OWASP projects.
- Provide first level dispute resolution for projects, which can be
  escalated to the Dispute Resolution process or in severe cases, the
  Foundation, Compliance Committee, or Board.
- Work with the Foundation to build operational automation and provide
  managed shared infrastructure for projects.
- Advise the Board or Foundation on relevant bylaws or policy changes.

### Promotion Process

#### Maturity Promotion

Promotions **from Incubator to Lab** level are reviewed by at least one
Project Committee member and one volunteer project leader or second
Project Committee member. The final decision is with the Project
Committee.

Promotions **from Lab to Production** level are reviewed by at least one
Project Committee member and one volunteer project leader or second
Project Committee member. The final decision is with the Project
Committee.

#### Strategic Promotion

Please note that promotions **to Flagship** level are not a maturity
progression from Production but *reserved for projects of strategic
importance to OWASP* and its mission. Requests to promotion to Flagship
will be evaluated by the Project Committee and a recommendation brought
to the OWASP Global Board. The final decision is with the Board.

Good OWASP Projects...

- **Uniqueness**
  1.  ...are submitted as Incubator projects after checking for (and
      considering to contribute to) a [possibily existing similar OWASP
      project](../projects/index.html) instead.
  2.  ...have a unique selling point (USP) or vision that sets them
      apart from [possibly existing similar OWASP
      projects](../projects/index.html).
- **Vendor Neutrality**
  1.  ...avoid names that are easily confused with existing
      organizations or their (commercial) services.
  2.  ...are truly free and Open Source and do not hide certain features
      behind any kind of paywall.
  3.  ...adhere to the ["Recognizing
      Supporters"](../www-policy/operational/donations.html#recognizing-supporters)
      section of the [Donations
      Policy](../www-policy/operational/donations.html) when referring
      to supporting individuals or organizations.
  4.  ...have their own social media presence (e.g. Twitter handle,
      YouTube channel) and do not "piggy-back" on ones used for
      commercial purposes.
  5.  ...have multiple Project Leaders who are not all employed by the
      same company.
- **Community Support**
  1.  ...have a channel on the official OWASP Slack optimally named
      `#project-<name>`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge} for easy
      filtering.
- **GitHub**
  1.  ...live under the <https://github.com/OWASP> GitHub organization
      and not in private GitHub accounts.
  2.  ...can alternatively have a dedicated GitHub organization if they
      consist of multiple repositories.
  3.  ...respond to GitHub issues and pull requests in a timely and
      friendly manner.
  4.  ...have all Project Leaders as administrators on their GitHub
      repository (especially when it lives outside of
      <https://github.com/OWASP>).
- **Website**
  1.  ...keep their `www-project-<name>`{.language-plaintext
      .highlighter-rouge} website up to date (especially regarding
      release information and project roadmap).
  2.  ...clearly state they are an OWASP project and link to their OWASP
      project page from any website they maintain.
