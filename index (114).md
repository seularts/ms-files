## Introduction

The primary aim of the OWASP Large Language Model Security Verification
Standard (LLMSVS) Project is to provide an open security standard for
systems which leverage artificial intelligence and Large Language
Models.

The standard provides a basis for designing, building, and testing
robust LLM backed applications, including architectural, model
lifecycle, model training, model operation and integration, model
storage and monitoring concerns.

Initial Draft Version - 0.1

The latest stable version is version 0.1 (dated February 2024), which
can be found:

- [OWASP Large Language Model Security Verification Standard 0.1 English
  (PDF)](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-llm-verification-standard/releases/tag/0.1)

The master branch of this repository will always be the "bleeding edge
version" which might have in-progress changes or other edits open.

either through significant time provision or financially on our

## Standard Objectives

The requirements were developed with the following objectives in mind:

1.  **Develop and Refine Security Guidelines**: Consolidate general
    objectives, including community involvement and standard evolution,
    into a comprehensive set of security guidelines for AI and LLM-based
    systems.
2.  **Address Unique Security Challenges of LLMs**: Focus specifically
    on the unique functional and non-functional security challenges
    presented by Large Language Models.
3.  **Guide Development Teams in Secure Practices**: Provide detailed
    guidance to development teams for implementing robust security
    measures in LLM-based applications.
4.  **Assist Security Teams in Audits and Penetration Testing**: Offer
    methodologies and standards for security teams to conduct effective
    security audits and penetration tests on LLM-backed systems.
5.  **Establish and Update Security Benchmarks**: Create and regularly
    update security benchmarks to align with the latest advancements in
    AI and cybersecurity.
6.  **Promote Best Practices in LLM Security**: Encourage the adoption
    of industry best practices in securing LLM-based systems.
7.  **Align Security Expectations Among Stakeholders**: Establish a
    common understanding of security expectations among developers,
    security professionals, vendors, and clients.
