Overview: The rise of API-driven architectures, microservices, and
cloud-native applications has increased the importance of securing API
gateways. While there are guidelines for securing APIs, there is no
comprehensive blueprint that focuses on the unique challenges and
security features needed for API gateways, which are critical
chokepoints in distributed systems.

The OWASP Secure API Gateway Blueprint project would aim to create a
framework, set of best practices, and reference implementations to guide
developers, architects, and security professionals in designing and
deploying secure API gateways.

### Road Map

Key Objectives:

Comprehensive Security Guidelines:

Develop actionable security guidelines specific to API gateways,
including authentication, authorization, rate limiting, logging,
encryption, and threat detection. Address challenges like API sprawl,
over-permissioned APIs, and token management.

Blueprint for Implementation:

Provide a detailed, vendor-agnostic blueprint for setting up secure API
gateways in different environments (e.g., on-premises, cloud, hybrid).
Include secure configurations for popular API gateway solutions (e.g.,
Kong, AWS API Gateway, Apigee, or Envoy).

Threat Modeling:

Create a catalog of common threats targeting API gateways, such as
injection attacks, token theft, and DDoS attacks. Provide threat
modeling templates and mitigation strategies.

Reference Implementations:

Develop open-source reference implementations for secure API gateway
configurations in multiple platforms and frameworks. Include CI/CD
pipelines that integrate automated security checks for gateway
deployments.

API Gateway Security Testing Suite:

Build and maintain a set of tools or a testing suite to help assess the
security posture of API gateways. Include automated tools to test for
vulnerabilities like misconfigurations, exposed sensitive APIs, and
inadequate rate limiting.

Developer and Security Awareness:

Create developer-friendly resources such as checklists, guides, and
e-learning modules. Publish case studies and real-world scenarios
demonstrating secure API gateway deployments and lessons learned from
failures.
