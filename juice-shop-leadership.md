OWASP Juice Shop proudly announces long-time contributor Jannik
Hollenbach as co-project lead effective immediately! Additionally, we
are enhancing and simplifying our contributor engagement & recognition.
Read on to learn more about these changes and how you can get involved
in the project!

## Project Leadership x2

Effective immediately, [Jannik
Hollenbach](https://infosec.exchange/@jannik) joins [Bjoern
Kimminich](https://bsky.app/profile/bkimminich.bsky.social) as
co-project lead of the OWASP Juice Shop. Jannik has been an an active
contributor to the project for many years. His achievements include
developing the [MultiJuicer](https://github.com/juice-shop/multi-juicer)
hosting-platform, building the [Hacking
Instructor](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/companion-guide/latest/part1/challenges.html#_hacking_instructor)
mechanism for our in-app tutorials, and fully re-creating the Score
Board in a modern tile-based layout.

Lacking a second project leader was an open topic of OWASP Juice Shop
since a new release of the [Project
Policy](../../../../www-policy/operational/projects-2.html) in 2021. Not
only are we now addressing this compliance issue, but an operational
continuity issue as well.

## Enhanced contributor engagement

Read on to learn more about our latest steps to enhance the contributor
engagement with OWASP Juice Shop for everyone, independent of experience
and level of involvement.

### Monthly contributor meeting now public

We always considered our **Juice Shop Developer Meeeting** on Google
Meet open for all past, current, and future contributors. But we totally
failed to advertise it actively, which changes now:

The **Juice Shop Developer Meeting** is scheduled **every two weeks on
Tuesday at 19:00-19:45 CET/CEST**. You can find the meeting series on
the [OWASP Event
Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=hl6cjgs6ep1h7oniqgueu2bhbo%40group.calendar.google.com).
For an invitation to the series, reach out to me [via
email](../../../../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#8fede5e0eafde1a1e4e6e2e2e6e1e6ece7cfe0f8eefcffa1e0fde8)
or a direct message on Slack and include your email address to invite.
You can also just hop on spontaneously as we intened to post the Google
Meet link on Slack as a reminder shortly before the meeting starts.

### Contributor Slack channel

We maintain two public channels on the official [OWASP
Slack](../../../../slack/invite.html) server, first of all the main
community channel [`project-juiceshop`{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge}](https://owasp.slack.com/archives/C255XSY04) for
questions, ideas and feedback. Second, the
[`juiceshop-dev`{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge}](https://owasp.slack.com/archives/CCGNHE0F4) channel
where CI/CD pipeline and test automation results are posted by bots.

For contributors, we have a dedicated private channel
[`juiceshop-contributors`{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge}](https://owasp.slack.com/archives/C05SF88UU73),
which you can easily join by pinging `@bkimminich`{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge} or `@Jannik`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}
in the public main channel or by sending either a direct message. We
will, for now, not make this channel public to avoid it getting used by
accident for support questions and other topics the
[`project-juiceshop`{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge}](https://owasp.slack.com/archives/C255XSY04) channel
is meant for.

### Google Summer of Code 2025

Juice Shop successfully participates in GSoC [under the OWASP
umbrella](../../../../www-community/initiatives/gsoc/gsoc2025.html)
since 2018. We provide true mentorship to our students, with weekly
meetings for the ideation & feedback cycles, and 1:1 sessions on demand
for troubleshooting or pair programming. You can find the overview of
all our previous projects on [our official
references](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/blob/master/REFERENCES.md#googlesummerofcode)
page.

In 2025, Juice Shop again promotes [several project
ideas](../../../../www-community/initiatives/gsoc/gsoc2025ideas.html#owasp-juice-shop)
to prospective students. In addition to the projects proposed by the
team, we are open to suggestions of entirely new project ideas. Feel
free to pitch yours directly to the listed mentor team!

Please note that the most successful GSoC projects usually come from
students who have already contributed to the project before, so if you
are interested in GSoC, start contributing now! Make sure to read our
[Contribution
Guidelines](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/companion-guide/latest/part3/contribution.html)
and optionally our [Codebase
101](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/companion-guide/latest/part3/codebase.html)
for newcomers.

## Simplified contributor recognition

With the above leadership and process changes, we are effeectively
abandoning the term "Core Team" from our website and repositories. Every
contributor should feel like a team member, regardless of their level of
involvement. We will continue to publish regular updates of our top
contributor diagram based on `git-stats`{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge} into our [Hall of
Fame](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/blob/master/HALL_OF_FAME.md#github-contributors):

![](../../../../../raw.githubusercontent.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/refs/heads/master/screenshots/git-stats.png)

The top-translators in our [CrowdIn
project](https://crowdin.com/project/owasp-juice-shop) will also
continue to be recognized on the [Hall of
Fame](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/blob/master/HALL_OF_FAME.md#translators)
of our main repository.

Repository and GitHub org level admin and maintainer permissions will
remain reserved for the project leaders and hand-selected trusted
contributors like our former "Core Team" members, top-contributors, and
GSoC mentors Timo Pagel & Shubbam Palriwala.
