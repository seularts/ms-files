# OWASP Software Component Verification Standard {#owasp-software-component-verification-standard .page-title}

The Software Component Verification Standard (SCVS) is a
community-driven effort to establish a framework for identifying
activities, controls, and best practices, which can help in identifying
and reducing risk in a software supply chain.

Managing risk in the software supply chain is important to reduce the
surface area of systems vulnerable to exploits, and to measure technical
debt as a barrier to remediation.

Measuring and improving software supply chain assurance is crucial for
success. Organizations with supply chain visibility are better equipped
to protect their brand, increase trust, reduce time-to-market, and
manage costs in the event of a supply chain incident.

Raising the bar for supply chain assurance requires the active
participation of risk managers, mission owners, and business units like
legal and procurement, which have not traditionally been involved with
technical implementation.

Determination of risk acceptance criteria is not a problem that can be
solved by enterprise tooling: it is up to risk managers and business
decision makers to evaluate the advantages and trade-offs of security
measures based on system exposure, regulatory requirements, and
constrained financial and human resources. Mandates that are internally
unachievable, or that bring development or procurement to a standstill,
constitute their own security and institutional risks.

SCVS is designed to be implemented incrementally, and to allow
organizations to phase in controls at different levels over time.

### SCVS has the following goals:

- Develop a common set of activities, controls, and best-practices that
  can reduce risk in a software supply chain
- Identify a baseline and path to mature software supply chain vigilance

### Availability

SCVS is available (in English) as PDF, Word (docx), JSON, or XML. These
artifacts can be found in the projects [GitHub
releases](https://github.com/OWASP/Software-Component-Verification-Standard/releases).
It can also be [read online](https://scvs.owasp.org/scvs/).

### Translations

The project maintainers are actively looking for volunteers to translate
SCVS into a number of languages. Please reach out on the projects Slack
channel or on GitHub if interested.
