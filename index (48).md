## Introduction

The OWASP Smart Contract Security Testing Guide (SCSTG) aims to provide
a comprehensive framework and methodology for testing the security of
smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and EVM-based
blockchain systems.

SCSTG is designed to help developers, auditors, and security
professionals effectively identify and mitigate vulnerabilities,
ensuring the robustness and reliability of smart contracts in
decentralized ecosystems.

We extend our gratitude to the organizations and individuals who have
supported the project through time, resources, or funding. You can find
the list of contributors and supporters on our
"[Supporter](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-scstg/blob/main/SUPPORTERS.md)"
page.

**Please [log issues](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-scstg/issues) if
you identify any bugs or have suggestions for improvement. Based on
discussions in the issues, we may ask you to [open a pull

## Initial Draft Version - 0.0.1 {#initial-draft-version---001}

The latest stable version is version 0.0.1 (dated September 2024),
available here:

- [OWASP Smart Contract Security Testing Guide 0.0.1 English
  (PDF)](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-scstg/releases/download/v0.0.1/OWASP_Smart_Contract_Security_Testing_Guide_v0.0.1.pdf)

The master branch of this repository contains the "bleeding edge
version," which may include in-progress changes or other updates.

## Guide Objectives

The SCSTG was developed with the following goals in mind:

1.  **Define Comprehensive Testing Methodologies**: Establish a detailed
    methodology for identifying vulnerabilities specific to smart
    contracts and blockchain ecosystems.
2.  **Standardize Security Testing Practices**: Provide a standardized
    approach for testing common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy,
    integer overflows/underflows, access control flaws, and economic
    attacks.
3.  **Enhance Testing Toolchains**: Offer guidance on leveraging
    existing security tools, such as fuzzers, symbolic execution tools,
    and static/dynamic analyzers, for smart contract testing.
4.  **Promote a Holistic Testing Approach**: Emphasize end-to-end
    testing, including on-chain behavior, business logic, and
    interaction with decentralized systems.
5.  **Educate Developers and Testers**: Help developers and testers
    understand the nuances of blockchain security testing and implement
    secure testing practices.
6.  **Keep Up with Evolving Threats**: Continuously update the guide to
    address new threats, attack vectors, and blockchain innovations.
7.  **Encourage Open Collaboration**: Promote collaboration among
    developers, security experts, and researchers to improve the quality
    and applicability of the guide.

The OWASP SCSTG project was initiated to share the knowledge gained from
the CredShields Security Team's research into Smart Contract security
while developing [**SolidityScan.com**](https://solidityscan.com/), an
AI-powered vulnerability scanner for Smart Contracts. We extend our
gratitude to [**CredShields**](https://credshields.com/) for their
efforts in defining the initial requirements and founding this project.
