## About OWASP Nest

OWASP Nest was originally created by **Arkadii Yakovets (Ark)** to
simplify OWASP project navigation. Built from scratch based on Ark's
vision and discussions with **Starr Brown (Starr)**, the platform
integrates structured system design into the OWASP ecosystem.

### Key Contributors

- **Arkadii Yakovets** -- Backend developer, leveraging over 10 years of
  experience in Python, Django, Django REST Framework (DRF), and related
  technologies. Built the backend using DRF, django-filter, OpenAI,
  Algolia Search, slack-bolt, PyGitHub, pre-commit, pytest, and more.
- **Kateryna Golovanova (Kate)** -- Led the initial frontend development
  using Vue.js and later became a project co-leader for her frontend and
  project management expertise.

### Evolution

Over time, OWASP Nest has expanded to address broader community needs,
such as Google Summer of Code (GSoC) student guidance and contribution
opportunities discovery. The platform, alongside NestBot, has become a
central hub for OWASP projects, chapters, users, and aggregated
contribution opportunities.

OWASP Nest's success is a testament to many valuable [community
contributions](https://github.com/OWASP/Nest/graphs/contributors),
shaping and improving the project in countless ways.
