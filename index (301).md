## Welcome

This is the website of the Portland, Oregon OWASP Chapter.

Our chapter is dedicated to the application security and information
security of the Pacific Northwest. Above are tabs to various elements of
our chapter activity. We host monthly chapter meetings with
presentations from regional security practitioners, and we collaborate
with other chapters in the Pacific Northwest to produce an annual appsec
conference called OWASP AppSec Days Pacific Northwest. The conference
has been running for three years. In 2023 it was held in Portland. In
2024 it will be in Vancouver, BC.

# Mentorship {#mentorship}

## What It Is

We're in the business of helping people grow. Whether you are a
beginner, and expert, or somewhere in between, we want to help you
develop as a professional. We work to pair you with someone who has
experience or is interest in the same area you are looking to mentor or
be mentored. It's about relationships, hands on keyboards, questions,
advice. A lot of the program is what you make out of the relationship we
seed you with.

## How to Get Involved

If you are interested in finding a mentor or being a mentor, please
contact one of our leaders in our chapter via email.

## Resources to Help

Here is our [resource
guide](https://owasp-pdx.gitbook.io/owasp-pdx-mentorship-resources/) for
our mentorship program. It is very much a work in progress (and we would
love your help if you want to throw some people hours at it).

# Participating

## Attendees

Our events are open to the public, and most events are free. Membership
in OWASP is not required, though if you are interested in supporting
OWASP's mission [we encourage you to
join](https://owasp.org/membership/).

If you have ideas about events you'd like to see OWASP offer or topics
you'd like to hear speakers address, contact any of the chapter leaders
or post a suggestion in
[Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-portland-chapter/) or on our
[OWASP Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T04T40NHX/CDYV8SKTR).
We'd love to hear from you.

## Volunteers

We are all volunteers! OWASP chapters are run entirely by volunteers. If
you would like to help us put on events, contact any of the chapter
leaders. You could help in many ways including:

- attending monthly chapter planning meetings
- attending events and greeting people who arrive
- identifying new people at events and helping them feel welcome
- finding speakers and venues
- being the coordinator for one or more monthly events
- being a mentor for people who participate in our mentorship program

In addition, our chapter helps plan larger events such as the annual
AppSec Pacific Northwest conference. In the past we have also offered an
annual training day. We sometimes need people to take on roles for those
events as well.

## Mentorship {#mentorship}

We have a mentorship program! If you would like help pursuing
appsec-related goals, we may be able to connect you with people who can
offer useful advice. Or if you have experience to share, we may be able
to pair you with someone who would like to receive it.

(Note that mentorship is not the same as training. Mentors offer
guidance, advice, and support, not a structured program for acquiring
knowledge.)

## Speakers

We are always looking for speakers to present at monthly events. We
accept a wide range of topics related to application security. If you
are interested, contact anyone on the leadership committee. (Be aware
that we try to keep our schedule booked some months in advance.)

We do not pay speakers. OWASP is a largely volunteer-run non-profit
organization.

### What We Ask from Speakers

What follows are standard expectations for all our events. Most of it
probably goes without saying, but I'm including it just to be clear.

We are looking for talks of about 30-50 minutes with time afterwards for
Q&A. We typically schedule events after work, around 5:30 or 6pm. Exact
time depends on the speaker and the venue.

We generally expect speakers to have visual aids (typically slides) and
to have practiced their presentation in advance. Venues may or may not
provide internet connectivity. We assume you are bringing a laptop with
slides and don't need anything from us except a hookup to a screen or
projector. We would be happy to post your presentation on our website
afterwards, but that is up to you.

[OWASP has a code of
conduct](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/code-of-conduct) and
we ask all participants in our chapter events to follow it. Among other
things it includes commitments to treating others with respect, not
plagiarizing, and not jeopardizing OWASP's objectivity and independence.

OWASP does not endorse products or services, and presentations at our
chapter events must not be pitches for a product or service. It is fine
to say who you are and what you offer when you introduce yourself, but
the purpose of the talk should be to convey vendor-neutral insights.

We ask speakers for a serious commitment to making the agreed date. If a
conflict arises that prevents you from participating, however, please
give us as much advance notice as possible so we can make other
arrangements.

## Hosts

We also need places to present. Typically we look for venues near
central Portland with capacity for 40 or more people and a screen or
monitor for projecting slides. Usually these are conference rooms or
other gathering areas that local companies generously allow us to use.

We acknowledge hosts when we publicize events on Meetup.com and in the
chapter's Slack channel, and again at the start of the event.

If you have space to offer or know someone who might, please contact any
of the chapter leaders.

## Sponsors

Since we usually schedule presentations after work around 5:30 or 6pm,
we appreciate it when someone is willing to provide food. Attendance
varies from event to event, so if you are interested in sponsoring
you'll want to contact any of the chapter leaders to identify specific
opportunities.

We acknowledge hosts when we publicize events on Meetup.com and in the
chapter's Slack channel, and again at the start of the event.
