# Welcome to the OWASP Student Chapter at RV University!

**Chapter Launch Date:** March 12, 2025

We are excited to announce the establishment of the OWASP Student
Chapter at RV University, dedicated to fostering a community of students
passionate about web application security. As part of the global Open
Web Application Security Project (OWASP), we aim to enhance the
understanding of cybersecurity principles and practices among our
members.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to promote awareness and education in web application
security through:

- **Workshops and Training Sessions:** Regular events focusing on the
  latest trends and technologies in cybersecurity.
- **Networking Opportunities:** Connect with industry professionals and
  peers to share knowledge and experiences.
- **Community Projects:** Engage in collaborative projects that
  contribute to open-source security tools and resources.

## Upcoming Events

Stay tuned for announcements regarding our upcoming meetups, workshops,
and guest lectures. We encourage all students, regardless of their
technical background, to participate and enhance their skills in
cybersecurity.

professional, your journey in cybersecurity starts here!

culture of cybersecurity at RV University!
