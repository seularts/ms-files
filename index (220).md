## Welcome

Welcome to the OWASP Waterloo Chapter home page!

The Waterloo Chapter is active & rebooted in January 2023.

Your chapter leaders are [Vinod Tiwari](https://twitter.com/securient),
and [Ajit Sharma](https://twitter.com/ajsway05)

## Our Goals

### Equality

We aim to bring together people from research, academia and industry to
motivate, and empower others to pursue a career in cybersecurity. By
raising awareness we work towards increasing diversity and equality in
cybersecurity.

### Education

We are committed to helping discover the next generation of
cybersecurity talent. We aim to offer mentorship programs to educate
those new to cybersecurity, and provide talks from industry
professionals to showcase all cybersecurity has to offer.

### Community Engagement

We want to help you connect with like-minded individuals. Whether you
are new to cybersecurity or a seasoned veteran, our goal is to build a
community where everyone can openly discuss and explore current issues
in cybersecurity, employment opportunities and more. By providing
networking opportunities, we want everyone to get involved in the
community and establish relationships with new people.
