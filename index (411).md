OWASP GTU-School of Engineering and Technology was founded in August
2021. We are a group of technical skilled college students on a mission
to disseminate the Cyber Awareness to our societies, and Sharpening up
Cyber security skills for our Students of GTU-SET! The chapter presents
many opportunities to the software community to secure application
development, Web/App Security, Penetration Testing, Bug Bounty, Ethical
Hacking and many more. Join our enthusiastic team to make Cyber Space a
Better Place!
