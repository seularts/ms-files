## Welcome

Welcome to the OWASP Yola chapter under the leadership of Sa'ad Ahmad
Sa'ad and Hussaini Aminu Suleiman.

Yola, meaning 'Great Plain' or 'Vast Plain Land', is the largest city,
capital city and administrative center of Adamawa State, Nigeria.
Located on the Benue River, it has a population of 336,648. Yola is
split into two parts.The old town of Yola where the Lamido resides is
the traditional city but the new city of Jimeta (about 5 km NW) is the
administrative and commercial centre. Generally the term Yola is now
used to mean both.

To the north are the Mandara Mountains and to the south are the Shebshi
Mountains with Dimlang (Vogel) Peak the second highest point (2,042 m)
in Nigeria after Chappal Waddi (mountain of death).

Yola is an access point to the Gashaka Gumpti Nature Reserve, which is
the largest national park in Nigeria, the Ngel Nyaki montane forest
reserve, the Mambilla Plateau, the Sukur UNESCO World heritage site,
which is Africa's first cultural landscape to receive World Heritage
List inscription,\[3\] the Yadin Waterfalls, the Kiri Dam on the Gongola
River, the Benue national park in nearby Cameroon, the Waza National
Park, and the Cameroonian town of Garoua, which lies across the border,
on the Benue river.

you can use it. You can't keep it, but you can spend it. Once you've
lost it, you can never get it back. Napoleon Bonaparte: Take time to
deliberate, but when the time for action arrives, stop thinking and go.
