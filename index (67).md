# ScrapPY: PDF Scraping Made Easy

ScrapPY is a Python utility for scraping manuals, documents, and other
sensitive PDFs to generate targeted wordlists that can be utilized by
offensive security tools to perform brute force, forced browsing, and
dictionary attacks. ScrapPY performs word frequency, entropy, and
metadata analysis, and can run in full output modes to craft custom
wordlists for targeted attacks. The tool dives deep to discover keywords
and phrases leading to potential passwords or hidden directories,
outputting to a text file that is readable by tools such as Hydra, Dirb,
and Nmap. Expedite initial access, vulnerability discovery, and lateral
movement with ScrapPY!

## Future Development:

- [x] Allow for custom output file naming and increased verbosity
- [x] Integrate different modes of operation including word frequency
  analysis
- [x] Allow for metadata analysis
- [x] Search for high-entropy data
- [ ] Search for path-like data
- [ ] Implement image OCR to enumerate data from images in PDFs
- [ ] Allow for processing of multiple PDFs
