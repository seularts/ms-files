It's becoming increasingly clear that we will need an AI Bill of
Materials (AIBOM). Just as with a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM),
there are potentially important questions when we use an AI model, which
we're not set up to answer meaningfully. As organizations increasingly
rely on AI to make decisions and automate processes, it becomes
essential to understand how these models are built, including the
datasets used, the data lineage, and the methodologies applied. This
initiative on AIBOM (MLBOM) aims to provide this visibility, ensuring
that AI systems are auditable and traceable, which helps mitigate risks
such as bias, data integrity issues, and unintended consequences.
Furthermore, as regulatory scrutiny of AI increases, AIBOM is a
foundational tool to demonstrate compliance and foster stakeholder
trust. The initiative will ensure ​​alignment and collaboration with OWASP
CycloneDX, OWASP AI Exchange, etc. Collaboration with CycloneDX will be
essential to defining the format and attributes of the AIBOM structure,
and collaboration with AIExchange will be necessary for an organization
to adopt the AIBOM.
