**Event Start Time:** Saturday, 10th Mar, 2018 at 10:00 AM (IST)

**Agenda:**

**1) Does your Pentesting cover all the basis of IT Security ?**

This talk focuses on how to align the security validation of a web
application with the three basic elements of security
namely,Confidentiality,Integrity, and Availability (CIA). The test
effectiveness can be achieved by analyzing the requirements of each
element and identifying the potential breaches that can compromise each
element. The efficiency should be built by relating these breaches with
the known OWASP Top 10 and other vulnerabilities and, leveraging that
knowledge to identify the testing approach - static and dynamic
throughout the SDLC.

**About Speakers:**

**Bhushan Gupta** has over 30 years of experience in software
engineering, 23 of which have been in the software industry. Although
