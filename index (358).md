## OWASP Lahore {#owasp-lahore-1}

In past years we have organized many infosec meetings as a small group
in coffee shops in Qatar and built a great community full of
enuthusiastic members who are willing to share the knowledge towards the
community. We were looking for a ways how to make it possible for you to
meet more often than three times per year.
