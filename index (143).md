Dojo Shield is an open-source initiative designed to teach secure
development practices through collaborative, hands-on workshops. It
targets developers, security professionals, and multidisciplinary teams,
aiming to bridge the gap between secure coding and real-world
application security.

Key features of the project:

- **Interactive Workshops**: Participants engage in resolving practical
  security challenges based on real-world scenarios, focusing on
  vulnerability remediation rather than exploitation.
- **Community-Centric Approach**: Encourages community participation by
  providing open guides and templates, enabling local adaptation and
  replication.
- **Multidisciplinary Inclusion**: While primarily aimed at developers,
  the project also includes challenges and workshops that benefit
  product managers, UX designers, and other tech professionals.
- **Global Accessibility**: Resources are made available in English and
  Portuguese, with plans for expansion into additional languages as the
  community grows.

The goal is to foster a collaborative learning environment where
participants enhance their secure coding skills, share knowledge, and
improve communication between development and security teams.

### Road Map

The Dojo Shield roadmap for 2025 includes the following key milestones:

**2025 Q1**: Structuring and Preparation

- Finalize facilitator and participant guides.
- Publish the initial set security challenges on GitHub. This challenges
  are content from another projects that give us the idea to realize the
  Dojo Shield and had worked well in another hands on.
- Launch social media accounts (LinkedIn, Instagram, Bluesky, and
  Mastodon).
- Begin development of the website, including features like challenge
  filters and a global map of workshops.

**2025 Q2**: Launch and Initial Events

- Release the website with all planned features.
- Conduct the first workshops with OWASP Chapters and local communities.
- Organize and host a global online event in March to introduce the
  project to OWASP Chapters and the broader tech community.
- Collect feedback from participants and facilitators.
- Begin documenting best practices and success stories from early
  adopters.

**2025 Q3**: Expansion and Adjustments

- Develop new challenges focused on emerging topics.
- Introduce a pipeline for community contributions on GitHub, allowing
  users to submit new challenges.
- Explore opportunities to engage product, UX, and QA teams with
  tailored workshop formats.

**2025 Q4**: Consolidation and Future Planning

- Publish an annual report with metrics, case studies, and participant
  feedback.
- Organize a global end-of-year event to celebrate the project's impact.
- Plan the 2026 roadmap, focusing on further expansion and multilingual
  support.
