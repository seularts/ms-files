Games today are massive ecosystems - combining players, servers, social
interactions, virtual economies, and even sports-level competition. The
Game Security Framework (GSF) is the de facto guide to understanding how
attackers exploit these systems and how developers can fight back.
Packed with threat models, real-world case studies, and actionable
strategies, the GFS equips you to root out vulnerabilities and keep
games fun, secure, and most of all - fair.

### Road Map

Phase 1: Incubator Stage ( 0-12 months ) **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**\_\_ Goal:
Establish foundation, complete drafts, and build community
engagement/partners

# 1-3 Months: Project Launch {#1-3-months-project-launch}

- Finalize scope and mission
- Identify/recruit contributors
- Draft structure for deliverables: Game Security Playbook (Core),
  Threat Models (Basic), Game Security Checklist

# 4-8 Months: Research & Draft Development {#4-8-months-research--draft-development}

- Game Defense Playbook Draft (Core); secure game development, cheat
  prevention, etc.
- Threat Models Draft (Basic); focused on multiplayer exploits, client
  integrity, and server vulnerabilities
- Game Security Checklist Draft; foundations of secure development and
  deployment practices
- Cheat & Exploit Taxonomy (Initial List); examples of common cheats and
  vulnerabilities
- Create 1-3 case studies

# 9-12 Months: Initial Deliverable Release {#9-12-months-initial-deliverable-release}

- Finalize drafts for presentation
- Gather feedback from gaming and security professionals
- Incorporate feedback into drafts to refine/revise

Phase 2: Lab Stage ( 13-24 months ) **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**\_\_ Goal:
Refine, expand, and provide tools

# 13-15 Months: Expanding Deliverables {#13-15-months-expanding-deliverables}

- Game Security Playbook v1; add in-depth sections on topics such as
  in-game economies, Esports integrity, and telemetry-based detections
- Threat Models v1; include comprehensive models for servers, virtual
  markets, competitive scenes, etc
- Game Security Checklist v1; polished checklist for developers and
  security teams
- Cheat & Exploit Taxonomy v1; categorized and expanded

# 16-18 Months: Community Engagement {#16-18-months-community-engagement}

- Publish 4-6 total Case Studies with real-world examples of gaming
  security incidents and mitigation strategies
- Request feedback from game professionals and establish usefulness
- Organize community engagement

# 19-21 Months: Open Source Tooling {#19-21-months-open-source-tooling}

- Develop and release: scripts, testing tools for servers/APIs, sample
  configurations for servers
- Publish tools with documentation for adoption

# 22-24 Months: Initial Finalization of Deliverables {#22-24-months-initial-finalization-of-deliverables}

- Finalize all Phase 2 deliverables (v1)
- Develop a plan for future updates and expansions

Phase 3: Push for Flagship ( 24+ months )

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Goal: Establish value of framework

# Year 3: Expansion

- Annual documentation updates; Game Security Playbook, Threat Models,
  and Game Security Checklist (v2+)
- Advanced Case Studies; AI, fraud, etc.
- Advanced Open Source Tooling; ML concepts, telemetry data analysis,
  server hardening configs, etc.

# Year 4: Gaming Security Trends Report

- Publish an annual report on the following: emerging threats, lessons
  learned, adoption metrics for framework

Essential Conditions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Active involvement from security professionals, game professionals,
  and contributors across communities (including OWASP) will be
  essential for gathering feedback, validating tools developed, and
  refining deliverables.
- Commitment from the Project Leader (myself) and the core team that
  will be established to maintain momentum and ensure completion of
  milestones.
- A focus on emerging threats and real-world use cases to ensure the
  Framework is useful to the industry.

Project Assumptions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The gaming industry will continue to face unique security challenges,
  resulting in a high demand for guidance and tooling to address
  vulnerabilities, cheats, etc.
- OWASP will continue to provide infrastructure for the project,
  branding, and outreach.
- Contributors will assist the project leadership in researching,
  producing/collecting feedback, and any development.
- The gaming industry will see the framework's value and adopt/foster
  its deliverables.
