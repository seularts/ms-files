## OWASP Yaounde Chapter Goals

Welcome to the Yaounde chapter homepage.

Cameroon is a diverse country located in Central Africa. In recent
years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of
information security, particularly from local professionals who have
been eager to build a community and foster progress. Furthermore, higher
learning institutions in Cameroon are now actively incorporating
cybersecurity education into their curricula, producing a new generation
of security professionals. The OWASP-Yaounde chapter seeks to contribute
to raising awareness about software security issues in Cameroon by
leveraging the resources and activities offered by the OWASP foundation.

Specifically, the wealth of knowledge and resources available through
the global OWASP community presents a valuable opportunity for
Cameroonian authorities, professionals, and recent graduates in terms of
training, best practices, and networking. Our primary mission is to
utilize these resources to foster a strong cybersecurity awareness
within Yaounde and throughout Cameroon. Do check out our sibling chapter
[OWASP Buea](../www-chapter-buea/index.html).
