## SecureFlag and OWASP partner to offer Threat Modeling Automation tool ThreatCanvas to Members {#secureflag-and-owasp-partner-to-offer-threat-modeling-automation-tool-threatcanvas-to-members}

OWASP members will gain extra benefits on the SecureFlag platform with
access to ThreatCanvas to automate expert-level threat models.

SecureFlag recently announced an initiative that offers existing and
future OWASP members access to their AI-powered threat modeling
automation tool, ThreatCanvas, a modeling solution for developers and
security professionals alike to generate threat models in seconds.

This new initiative builds on the successful four-year collaboration
providing OWASP members access to a reserved instance of the SecureFlag
Secure Coding Training platform.

ThreatCanvas can quickly generate a threat model from a textual
description, an Infrastructure-as-Code template, and soon, existing
diagrams. The scope is anything from an individual feature to an entire
application or systems. ThreatCanvas identifies potential threats and
suggests the relevant security controls to address any issues.

ThreatCanvas integrates seamlessly with SecureFlag's training platform,
providing hands-on labs tailored to identified threats and expanding
upon the existing OWASP member access to the SecureFlag Platform.

"Threat modeling should be part of the Software Development Life Cycle
(SDLC), but it's hard to scale because it's a manual process and
requires specialized security knowledge.

"SecureFlag's ThreatCanvas changes this, making threat modeling a
scalable activity that developers can perform without adding overhead to
their busy schedules and without relying on the security team. With
ThreatCanvas, we can empower developers to create secure software from
the start and reduce security rework later in the development pipeline,"
said Andrea Scaduto, Co-Founder & Director at SecureFlag.

OWASP members gain access to ThreatCanvas, leveraging most of the
features available in ThreatCanvas Pro. It's possible to generate
unlimited threat models, refine them, save (one model at the time) in
their library, browse revisions, export any created models via JSON or
generated PDF reports and much more. OWASP members will also continue to
benefit from access to SecureFlag's hands-on security training labs.
These labs virtualize real developer environments, covering a wide range
of technologies and scenarios.

"Threat modeling is the heart and soul of application security.
SecureFlag's new ThreatCanvas feature will be a welcome addition to the
already great SecureFlag member benefit," says Andrew van der Stock,
Executive Director of the OWASP Foundation, and co-leader of the OWASP
Top 10. "I look forward to seeing how our members use ThreatCanvas to
model their applications."

ThreatCanvas provides developers with access to expert-level threat
modeling automation to create software that is secure from the start. To
learn more about ThreatCanvas or to register on the SecureFlag Platform
