and we will be moving forward from here on with all our projects and
sessions.

The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit
foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our
projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapters

contributions should only be made online using the authorized online
donation button.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our
