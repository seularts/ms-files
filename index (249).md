## Welcome

Welcome to *OWASP Stuttgart Chapter*. Our Chapter serves southern
Germany particular within the Swabia region as a platform to discuss and
share topics all around information and application security.

Anyone interested and enthusiastic about application security is
welcome. All meetings are free and open. **You do not have to be an
OWASP member**.

Referrals to this website or to individual meetings to colleagues or
acquaintances are welcome.

## Upcoming Events

Check out our [Upcoming
Events](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/owasp-stuttgart-chapter/).

## Information about Stuttgart Chapter Events

### When?

We will be running quarterly chapter meetups with the option to have
additional events such as hands-on workshops.

The dates will be picked randomly to avoid recurring conflicts with
other events (meetups, private obligations, holiday etc.). Typically, we
choose a day from Tuesday to Thursday for our events, as our experience
in organizing them has shown that Mondays and Fridays often have a very
high no-show rate. ðŸ˜¬

Events usually start at 18:00 with guests arriving and socialising. By
18:30, we proceed with the talk from our guest speaker or dive into the
planned activities for the evening.

### Where?

All our upcoming events are announced on Meetup:
[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/owasp-stuttgart-chapter/).

## Organization

### Call for Speakers and Volunteers

**We are looking for presentations for the next OWASP Stuttgart Chapter
Events!** If you'd like to give a presentation, conduct a training
workshop or volunteer for us, contact us the OWASP Stuttgart Chapter
leaders.

### Etiquette

Please note that vendor pitches are not allowed, so please adhere to the
[OWASP Speaker Agreement](../www-policy/legal/speaker-agreement.html)
and avoid marketing stunts. Also, please ensure to remove your company
logos from all but one "marketing" slide.
