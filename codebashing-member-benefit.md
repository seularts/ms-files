OWASP chapters and members gain Codebashing access to boost adoption of
application security and compliance standards while building trust
between security and development teams. Read on to learn more about the
Codebashing AppSec Training Initiative.

PARAMUS, NJ -- April 18, 2024 -- Checkmarx, the leader in cloud-native
application security, today announced the Codebashing AppSec Training
Initiative in partnership with the Open Worldwide Application Security
Project, (OWASP). The program will provide OWASP chapters and their
members around the world with access to the Codebashing AppSec solution
to ease the adoption of application security (AppSec) and compliance
standards and build trust between security and development teams.

OWASP is an online community that produces freely available articles,
methodologies, documentation, tools, and technologies in the fields of
IoT, system software and application security.

With over seven million minutes of AppSec training each year and a
lesson completion rate of over 95%, Codebashing equips developers with
the tools and knowledge to improve their secure coding skills. Delivered
as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution, Codebashing offers a
compelling way for security teams to better engage developers for AppSec
adoption and standards compliance. Learning key AppSec concepts within
their familiar workspaces and applying those concepts from the first
line of code across all applications improves productivity and lowers
risk while making the AppSec process more enjoyable.

Codebashing seamlessly merges with a developer's daily tasks, offering
learning modules within their IDEs via Checkmarx One plugins. Its
innovative 'Learning Path' approach promotes continuous skill
enhancement and is finely tuned to a developer's specific role, be it
back-end, front-end or DevOps.

Checkmarx' renowned security researchers have curated over 85 lessons to
shape the "Security Champion Program," a visually engaging path guiding
developers towards mastery. On completion, participants earn an
exclusive Security Champion certificate endorsed by Checkmarx.

In the new joint program with OWASP, Checkmarx has made Codebashing
available to all OWASP members for a duration of one year beginning
DATE. Once they've completed the program, participants will receive the
Checkmarx AppSec Pro Certification for OWASP Members.

"Checkmarx appreciates the hard work and commitment of the OWASP
Foundation and its global network of chapters and members in bringing
Application Security to the forefront in an increasingly challenging
threat landscape," remarked Sandeep Johri, CEO at Checkmarx. "Our
Checkmarx research team -- and the entire company -- are long-time
supporters and contributors to the OWASP Foundation, both globally and
locally. This new initiative will further strengthen Checkmarx One
leadership to build trust between security and developers while
equipping and training a new generation of software developers on
emerging software supply chain threats."

"The OWASP mission is to make the best resources available to help raise
the security standards of applications now being developed and deployed
-- the same applications running businesses, governments, and
mission-critical processes around the world," said Andrew van der Stock,
Executive Director of OWASP. "We're pleased to work with Checkmarx to
make Codebashing available to our members, which will help ease the
process of application security and build better relationships between
security and development teams."

"The best way to ensure secure development by design is through training
and awareness. AppSec training should be a part of any comprehensive
security program," said Ori Bendet, VP of Product Management at
Checkmarx. "We're truly pleased to work with OWASP to give their members
this opportunity to strengthen their AppSec defenses in an engaging
way."

The Checkmarx research team has long contributed to the software
development and security communities by educating and raising awareness
through its publications, presentations at leading conferences, and
AppSec Village events. Checkmarx VP of Security Research Erez Yalon
founded and has led the API Security project at OWASP since 2019.

Codebashing further extends that commitment to helping the software
development community learn more and do better in everything related to
application security. The training solution helps developers at all
levels better understand concepts and terminology in AppSec, and from
theory to practice, experience and solve real-time secure code
challenges. Offering courses and mini-lessons in all leading coding
languages, Codebashing covers all leading security vulnerabilities in an
engaging and interactive way.
