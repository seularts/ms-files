Oftentimes motivating security champions is a challenge. Most of the
time, they're not willing to dedicate the time and effort to the
invisible part of security. The product owners themselves focus on
pushing the developement of features therefore the nessecity of security
is often neglected or almost completely overlooked. Broken
authentification.png That is why there is a need to visualize the
investment in security, made by a champion or an entire team. One
solution would be to give out corresponding buttons for every security
event the champions attend. Those events could be something along the
lines of a threat modeling session with OWASP Cornucopia or any other
relevant topics. The buttons can be seen as a reward given to the
representatives of each team, showcased in the team rooms. Preferably on
a white hat or a sash. This concept could also be implemented with
stickers. As an alternative to reward the attendency of a meeting, the
actual implementation (e.g. using of a hardened image) might be
rewarded.

Benefits:

- A teams effort in security is visible and therefore measureable
- teams are able to compare each others achievements, especially with
  different skill levels (e.g. XSS Basics and XSS Advanced events)
- Security Champions are able to get some kind of certification
- This project could help engange others in the topic of security
